\chapter{some useful rituals}
\thispagestyle{scrheadings}
\label{appendix}
While imperial lore contains a great number of different rituals in all the different realms, even a landskeeper not practicing the magickal arts themself should be aware of some useful rituals, and at least roughly ken what is necessary to enact them – not only are these rituals useful with some regularity, they also give a good idea of what magick of low power can easily do.
\paragraph{barked command of the iron serjant}
autumn \s{magnitude} 9.  This ritual enchants up to three targets from
one banner. This ritual can affect additional targets from the
same banner, every two additional targets increase the magnitude by 5.
\localpar
The ritual requires the participation of a member of that banner who
is skilled in fighting with long weapons. All targets gain the ability
to fight with either one-handed spear, or two-handed weapon, or
pole-arm, or pike, chosen by the drill serjant.
\localpar
In addition, while the enchantment lasts (until the end of their next
battle, skirmish or quest, but at most a few days), the targets feel a
desire to stick together, fighting alongside each other and with the
character who trained them in their new combat skill.
\paragraph{blessing of new spring} spring \s{magnitude} 2. This ritual targets a farm. The yeoman who owns the farm must be present througout. The power of this ritual infuses animals and plants with vigour and fertility. Crops grow quickly, and in great abundance; they are naturally healthy and resistant to threats such as harsh weather, frost, disease and parasites. Animals are fruitful, with large litters, and young creatures grow quickly and enjoy great health. If there is a downside to the ritual it is that it increases the amount of work that must be done - crops must constantly be tended for weeds, and animals become a little more restive as they become more fruitful. 
\localpar
The farm earns an additional 10 rings over each season before the spring equinox, the summer solstice and the autumn equinox. The ritual ends at the start of winter. This ritual is intended to be cast at the winter solstice. It can affect additional farms in the same territory. Each additional farm increases the magnitude by 1.
\paragraph{bright lantern of ophis} day \s{magnitude} 6. The ritual reveals information about an enchantment, \s{curse} or other magickal effect. It is most often used on a character or item that is present. It can also be used on a special effect that is anchored to an area.
\localpar
The ritua provides information on realm and magnitude of the effect; it determines what the effect does, and provides details of how it works; it reveals any remaining duration; it reveals any conditional effects, or any special methods that exist for removing the effect; it may provide information about where the magickal effect has come from (a ritual or the supernatural abilities of an \s{eternal}, for example). The lanskeepers may increase the magnitude of the ritual to penetrate more powerful shrouds or masks.
\paragraph{circle of gold} autumn \s{magnitude} 9. This ritual targets up to five characters from the same band. Each character must be present throughout. The target characters gain the ability call another character who was also a target of this ritual back to their side after being downed, without having to use heroic might.
\localpar
All targets of the ritual feel a desire to stick together, whether on the battlefield or off it. They feel a strong urge to defend the other targets of the ritual, whether from physical harm or from insults. The effect lasts until the end of the next \s{battle}, skirmish or quest the character participates in; but at most a few days. This ritual can affect additional characters from the same band. Every two additional characters increases the magnitude by 3. Additional characters must be present throughout. Any caster who has mastered can use weltsilver instead of crystal mana when contributing to it. Every 2 ingots of weltsilver spent work like 1 crystal mana when contributing to the ritual.
\paragraph{gathering the harvest} autumn \s{magnitude} 15. This ritual targets a farm which must already be enchanted with the strong ox, golden sun ritual. The yeoman who owns the farm must be present throughout. A farm effected by the ritual will gather its crops faster, and with less wastage; the weather remains fairer for longer; and all the minor elements that might damage or reduce the value of a crop tend to be mitigated or avoided. Every harvest is a bumper harvest under this ritual; stalks bend practically double with corn and wheat, fruit are oversized and succulent, animals are fat and complacent to the slaughter. The ritual ensures wealth, prosperity and comfort for the farmers and their families, as well as plenty left over to sell at profit.
\localpar
The ritual farm earns an additional 400 rings surplus for the autumn equinox. The ritual ends at the start of winter. This ritual is intended to be cast at the summer solstice. If the spell is cast earlier in the year, then money that would have been gained from strong ox, golden sun or blessing of new spring is lost. The effect lasts until the start of the next summit. This ritual can affect additional farms in the same territory. Each additional farm increases the magnitude by 12.
\paragraph{strong ox, golden sun} summer \s{magnitude} 4. This ritual targets a farm which must already be enchanted with the blessing of new spring ritual. The yeoman who owns the farm must be present througout. The ritual enchants both domesticated beasts of burden and farm-workers alike, giving them great stamina and keeping them hearty and hale. Oxen can haul a plough for days on end without complaint, while labourers find their exertions tire them, but do not exhaust them. The fields themselves burst with grain, and herds of animals are hardy, healthy and gain strength to fight off predators and disease alike. 
\localpar
The target farm earns an additional 50 rings at the summer solstice and the autumn equinox. The ritual ends at the start of winter. This ritual is intended to be cast at the spring equinox. If it is cast later in the year, then money that would have been gained in earlier seasons is lost. It is useless if performed after the summer solstice. It can affect additional farms in the same territory. Each additional farm increases the magnitude by 2.
\paragraph{wisdom of the balanced blade} winter \s{magnitude} 6. The ritual reveals information about any and all curses on the target. It is most often used on a character or item that is present, but can also be used in an area that is under a curse such as that created by Naeve's Twisting Blight.
\localpar
When completed the ritual provides the following information about each curse that is present:
    It determines the realm and magnitude of the effect;
    It determines what the effect does, and provides details of how it works;
    It reveals any remaining duration;
    It reveals any conditional effects, or any special methods that exist for removing the effect; It may suggest specific rituals that can remove the curse, or a general class of effects that might be appropriate;
    It may provide information about where the curse has come from (a ritual or the supernatural abilities of an Eternal, for example).
\localpar
Some of these effects are similar to those provided by detect magick, but unlike that spell, Wisdom of the Balanced Blade can penetrate effects designed to stymie or confuse divinations. The ritual must match or exceed the magnitude of any concealing effect on the item to penetrate it; otherwise the only information the ritual will reveal is whether the item is bonded or not; that there is an obscuring effect; and the magnitude and realm of that effect.
\paragraph{withering touch of frost} winter \s{magnitude} 6. This
ritual creates a curse that is delivered to a target with a
pronouncement of doom: one contributor is chosen to deliver the curse,
and they must do so within fifteen minutes or it falls on their own
head. This curse, which lasts a year, focuses the withering energies
of the Winter realm onto a target, who feels chilly all the time,
unless they are actively warming themselves at a flame.
\localpar
In addition, the winter energy flows through them onto whatever they
are cultivating. Plants wither and die, or are attacked by
parasites. It makes little difference if the target abandons their
culture – within a few days the same unnatural decay begins to
overwhelm their new farm, forest or herb garden, and they lose a
quarter of the produce.
