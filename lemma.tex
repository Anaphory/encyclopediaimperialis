\paragraph{abbot} t'\allowbreak head \see{monk} of a \see{monastery}. Often addressed as “father” or “mother”. 
\paragraph{abuse of powers}t'religious \see{crime} of abusing t'\allowbreak powers of a priest. This includes t'\allowbreak powers of t'\allowbreak synod, as well as liao ceremonies.
\paragraph{Alderly} a forested region in central \see{Mournwold}, held by t'\allowbreak \see{jotun}.
\paragraph{aldermen} a representative of a \see{market town}. In most cases these men or women are wealthy merchants of t'\allowbreak town, but often they include prominent town folk such as a \see{friar} or blacksmith who lives in t'\allowbreak village. Those market towns that employ their own militia usually raise t'\allowbreak captain to t'\allowbreak rank of alderman. T'\allowbreak innkeeper is almost invariably an alderman of t'\allowbreak town and can be one of t'\allowbreak wealthiest members of t'\allowbreak community. Many aldermen take great pride in their ceremonial chains of office. Several towns are in competition in providing t'\allowbreak most magnificent chain for their representative, and some go so far as to commission them as \see{magickal item}s, such as an Alderman's Edge. \proverb{Without labor nothing prospers.}
\paragraph{ambergelt} a resin in red or similar colours, generally symbolised by a wasp. Used by \see{magicksmith}s to create \see{magickal item}s that heal, slow or preserve life. Also used for decoration, or as a resinous varnish.
\paragraph{Ambition} a \see{virtue} \proverb{There's never a tree so big it can't be felled.}
\paragraph{amity} (do not confuse with \see{enmity}) means that an \see{eternal} and their \see{herald}s are considered to be \see{foreigner}s, and therefore have t'\allowbreak same protection under t'\allowbreak \see{law} as Imperial \see{citizen}s.
\paragraph{anoint} a priestly ceremony strengthening t'\allowbreak immediate connection between an individual and a \see{virtue} for short time.
\paragraph{Anvil} location of t'\allowbreak \see{sentinel gate} and t'\allowbreak \see{senate} and capital location of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}. Four times a year t'\allowbreak powerful citizens of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} meet here to determine t'\allowbreak future of their people. Founded on t'\allowbreak ruins of t'\allowbreak old smithy in which t'\allowbreak \see{first Empress} took shelter from her enemies when a young woman, Anvil is said to be where t'\allowbreak first open declaration of t'\allowbreak dream of \see{Empire} was made. After her ascension to t'\allowbreak throne, t'\allowbreak Empress declared that t'\allowbreak small settlement would be preserved for t'\allowbreak lifetime of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} in memory of sacrifices made by those sheltering her. Since then Imperial parliaments have been held there, but t'\allowbreak town itself has never been allowed to grow. In addition to t'\allowbreak senate and sentinel gate, Anvil's permanent features are t'\allowbreak Forge (now a pub), t'\allowbreak Imperial \see{regio} and t'\allowbreak site of t'\allowbreak war memorial.%Tyke's eatery (\emph{Dine at Tyke's!}) 
\paragraph{Applewood} a village in \see{Stock March}, founded by a coalition of several \see{household}s after a particularly vicious \see{Feni} attack in t'\allowbreak \allowbreak 370s.
\paragraph{artisan} a skilled craft worker who makes or creates things by hand that may be functional or strictly decorative. Often used synonymously with \see{magicksmith}.

\paragraph{Ashbrook} a region and eponymous river in \see{Upwold}.
\paragraph{assembly} t'\allowbreak individual bodies of t'\allowbreak \see{synod} are referred to as assemblies. T'Marcher assembly, and most \see{virtue} assemblies, welcome interested laypeople such as \see{pilgrim}s of t'\allowbreak way, friars, or priests without a congregation, even though these individuals do not have t'\allowbreak right to vote on judgements.
\paragraph{autumn} 1: a season 2: t'\allowbreak \see{magick}al realm of wealth, bargins and power \proverb{Reap what you sow, come rain, shine or snow.}
\paragraph{bailiff of t'grand market} T'Bailiff of t'\allowbreak grand market is an Imperial title awarded to a Marcher citizen. It is a Marcher position appointed through t'\allowbreak Bourse but chosen by Marcher yeomen with votes allocated based on t'\allowbreak size of their farm holdings. T'Bailiff has offices in Meade, but it is a rare Bailiff who spends much time there. While t'\allowbreak title is associated closely with t'\allowbreak weekly or bi-weekly markets of Mitwold, t'\allowbreak Bailiff is regularly involved in trade fairs and markets across t'\allowbreak Marches, and Marchers from every territory have regularly held t'\allowbreak post. T'title pre-dates t'\allowbreak formation of t'\allowbreak \see{market town}s, and comes from a time when almost every town and village in t'\allowbreak nation would have their own regular market. Traditionally t'\allowbreak Bailiff's role was to ensure security at fairs and markets across t'\allowbreak Marches. In return, they were guaranteed a hearty meal, a minimum of one meat pie and a tankard of ale. More importantly, however, to help t'\allowbreak Bailiff meet t'\allowbreak costs of their office they were given t'\allowbreak opportunity to buy some goods before t'\allowbreak market officially opened allowing shrewd bailiffs to secure bargains for themselves. Many markets considered it a matter of Pride to ensure that t'\allowbreak Bailiff turned a good profit in exchange for their hard work in keeping t'\allowbreak marketplace safe and fair for all. Within t'\allowbreak space of a season, t'\allowbreak Bailiff might find themselves in a position to buy beggar's lye and ambergelt at a fair from a village in t'\allowbreak birchwoods of \see{Upwold}; a cask of Wintermark mead and some measures of \see{dragonbone} from a Suaq peddlar in a town square in \see{Mitwold}; a basket of tempest jade from a scowling stallholder at t'\allowbreak great market in Meade; a basket of assorted herbs at a dour fair in \see{Bregasland} or even a handful of \see{crystal mana} at a strained gathering in Overton. When t'\allowbreak Marches joined t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} some of t'\allowbreak more expensive responsibilities of t'\allowbreak Bailiff were assumed by t'\allowbreak civil service. Marchers are loath to abandon their traditions however; t'\allowbreak presence of an honest Bailiff was considered to be good for trade as it let everyone ken that t'\allowbreak market was safe to travel to. With t'\allowbreak help of Emperor Giovanni t'\allowbreak role of Bailiff was incorporated into t'\allowbreak Bourse, to allow t'\allowbreak \see{civil service} to identify t'\allowbreak individual with t'\allowbreak most support from other yeomen. T'Bailiff is expected to ensure fairs, markets and trade gatherings in t'\allowbreak Marches are undertaken in a traditional and honest fashion. They also have some responsibility for ensuring that t'\allowbreak major roads between towns and villages remain free of bandits and \see{Feni} who might otherwise restrict trade. In practice, this is quite a tall order for a single individual – many markets have their own local bailiff or sheriff who sees to t'\allowbreak security of their fair. Specifically, t'\allowbreak Bailiff oversees t'\allowbreak grand market in Meade which takes place on t'\allowbreak third weekend of each month and attracts traders from across t'\allowbreak Marches and even occasionally from Wintermark to t'\allowbreak north. 
\paragraph{barbarian} anyone with whom t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} is at war, including during a ceasefire. \see{eternal}s and t'\allowbreak \see{herald}s of \see{eternal}s who are t'\allowbreak subject of a declaration of \see{enmity} by t'\allowbreak \see{conclave} are considered enemies of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} and treated as barbarians. Unauthorised dealings with barbarians are illegal and will be investigated as treason. Any delegations from barbarian nations who arrive on t'\allowbreak field of Anvil under a flag of peace have protection under t'\allowbreak \see{law} as if they were Imperial citizens for t'\allowbreak duration of their visit and for their direct passage out of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}. Otherwise barbarians have no protection under t'\allowbreak law.\proverb{Where t'hedge is lowest men jump over.}
\paragraph{battle} a fight between many people on each side. In \see{Anvil}, \see{constellation}s usually permit two battles per week facilitated through t'\allowbreak \see{sentinel gate}, involving fighters from five \see{nation}s to pass through t'\allowbreak gate.
\paragraph{beak} t'\allowbreak hard mouth of a bird or herald of \see{Lashonar}.
\paragraph{beater} beaters roam t'\allowbreak Marches, learning every part of t'\allowbreak land, watching for thieves, vagrants and other ne'er-do-wells. Beaters mark out what land belongs to whom.  Beaters are often instrumental in settling land disputes between neighbours and they still play a vital role in t'\allowbreak tradition of t'\allowbreak \see{beating of t'bounds}. T'beating of t'\allowbreak bounds usually takes place after t'\allowbreak harvest is in. At this festival every Marcher marks their land, by walking around t'\allowbreak boundary led by t'\allowbreak beaters. Certain stones, trees or other marker points around t'\allowbreak boundary are beaten literally, ceremonially striking them with sticks or willow wands. T'\see{market town}s beat t'\allowbreak boundaries laid out by their warrant, and individual towners often have a second ceremony in which they beat t'\allowbreak bounds of their shop or workplace. T'ceremony is designed to remind all of t'\allowbreak size of t'\allowbreak holding, but it also works to remind everyone of who is part of t'\allowbreak community and who is outside it. On a practical level, t'\allowbreak beating of t'\allowbreak bounds is often preceded by t'\allowbreak beaters ensuring that t'\allowbreak boundary areas are safe for t'\allowbreak upcoming ceremony, and followed by a period of maintaining and replacing whatever physical markers delineate t'\allowbreak bounds – it is a time for repairing fences, planting hedges and t'\allowbreak like. Beaters often live off t'\allowbreak land and most are skilled woodsmen and hunters. They serve as an informal police force, investigating crimes and tracking criminals. While an individual beater often associates with one or more \see{household}s, they make no secret of t'\allowbreak fact that they maintain an informal network among themselves. T'beaters watch t'\allowbreak boundaries and defend them against trespass until its forces can muster. They also remain vigilant for internal threats. In addition to t'\allowbreak orcs that still occupy t'\allowbreak more inaccessible hills and wild forests of t'\allowbreak Marches, there are bands of \see{Feni} who launch raids against civilised Marchers to steal metal, cattle or crops. If something or someone is raiding out of t'\allowbreak forests or hills then t'\allowbreak beaters are t'\allowbreak ones who are called on to hunt it. T'third Marcher army, t'\allowbreak \see{bounders} of \see{Upwold}, contains a large number of beaters.
\paragraph{beater's gate} A wayhouse south of \see{Greywater}, kent for its hospitability, in particular to travelling \see{beater}s. T'house was set up by Bobby Greyshanks (owner of \see{Bobby's bridge}) to provide accommodation for weary travellers.
\paragraph{beating of t'bounds} festival in autumn, after t'\allowbreak gathering of harvest, when \see{beater}s lead t'\allowbreak communities in remembering who and what is part of t'\allowbreak community, or not. \proverb{Friends are t'family we choose ourselves.}
\paragraph{becoming a Marcher} \see{march}
\paragraph{beggar's lye} a liquid solution produced from tree ash, generally symbolised by a skull. Used by magicksmiths as a caustic or primer that changes material properties in t'\allowbreak process of creating \see{magickal item}s.
\paragraph{Birchland} a region in \see{Upwold}, fortified by t'\allowbreak ancient \see{eastern guard}.
\paragraph{blasphemy} t'\allowbreak religious \see{crime} of denigrating of t'\allowbreak \see{paragon}s and t'\allowbreak paths of \see{virtue}. This includes promoting false virtues and t'\allowbreak teachings, or example, of false exemplars or false \see{paragon}s.
\paragraph{bleeding out} a serious \see{injury} can leave a soldier bleeding out, such that they will die after a few minutes (less if \see{poison}ed) unless saved by a healer of any competency.
\paragraph{Bobby's brigde} \see{Brock's toll}
\paragraph{boggart} a class of \see{vermin}, believed to have originated from t'\allowbreak Realm of \see{night}. They vary from being cat-sized to about t'\allowbreak size of a grown adult. Boggarts are manavores and deliberately seek out flows of magick, and t'\allowbreak places they pool, to feed upon. Possessing an inherent magick akin to t'\allowbreak \see{ritual} Twilight Masquerade, their primary defence is camouflage, and they rarely approach or attack citizens. Boggart feces are also kent to enrich – or perhaps transform – soils and enhance their fertility. Consequently, rarified boggart manure is sought after to enhance production of herb gardens or farms. T'potency of these feces fades however swiftly. 
\paragraph{Bolstering Bill} or \keyword{Wilhelmina} \see{exemplar} of \see{Loyalty}. As a famous folk hero, many stories describe her exploits. She is usually depicted with her eponymous weapon, giving a hand to a comrade.\begin{figure} \centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Wilhelmina} \caption{Bolstering Bill*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{boundary dispute} when two Marchers both claim a piece of land, they should ask a wise \see{beater} from their region to settle t'\allowbreak matter. If they cannot be settled, a sportive competition, such as games of tug-of-war, is a good matter to settle t'\allowbreak dispute, once and for all or on a yearly cycle.
\paragraph{bounders} \keyword{1)} t'\allowbreak third army of t'Marches, made up from ruthless \see{Upwold} \see{yeomen}, \see{beater}s and \see{landskeeper}s \begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/TheBounders}\caption{Bounders emblem}\end{figure} 2) \keyword{Boundarymen}, a group of Upwold \see{beater}s, scouts and \see{yeomen} connected to t'\allowbreak Bounders army, with t'\allowbreak taken duty of keeping t'\allowbreak land safe.
\paragraph{bourse} one of t'\allowbreak great councils according to t'\allowbreak \see{constitution}. T'bourse is designed to ensure that \see{ilium}, \see{mithril}, \see{weirwood} and \see{white granite} are directed to where they can provide t'\allowbreak most economic benefit, rather than being assigned by political or military patronage. Merchants bid for a position on t'\allowbreak bourse and those that are successful gain control of one of t'\allowbreak bourse positions that control production.\proverb{Nothing ventured, nothing gained.}
\paragraph{brass coast} a \see{nation} of t'\see{Empire} where everything has a price in rings. An individual from t'\allowbreak coast is a “freeborn”.
\paragraph{Bregasland} t'\allowbreak westernmost of t'\allowbreak Marches territories, comprising partially of fenland leading to t'\allowbreak coast of \see{Westmere}. T'territory is a place of small islands of abundantly fertile soil, surrounded by seemingly endless marshes where eels are caught. There are several \see{household}s here made up entirely of \see{merrow}, and several settlements populated by \see{shun}ned who cannot bring themselves to leave t'\allowbreak Marches. Bregasland is home to partially sunken ruins, including several stone circles that pre-date Marcher possession of t'\allowbreak land, and a variety of beasts and natural phenomena haunting t'\allowbreak fens, such as \see{marshwalker}s, \see{willot'wisp}s, etc.
\paragraph{briar} a type of \see{lineaged}, touched by t'\allowbreak \see{magick}al realm of \see{spring}. They mate and breed just like humans, they have hair, and they give birth to live offspring. Briars are almost never born expressing their lineage. Their lineage appears when they sustain a serious injury, with t'\allowbreak site of t'\allowbreak injury quickly covered in a thick scab with t'\allowbreak texture and appearance of bark. Many people show no signs at all of being a briar before t'\allowbreak bark appears. Once that happens, changes tend to happen quickly, thorns may appear growing through t'\allowbreak skin and t'\allowbreak eyes may turn green. T'psychological effects of lineage appear at t'\allowbreak same time. If a briar is wounded and healed with spring magick this can strengthen a briar's lineage; t'\allowbreak physical and mental signs become more evident. After death, a briar’s entire body is slowly covered with bark, appearing a lot like a misshapen, fallen log. It is a common belief that a briar who avoids magickal healing will lose t'\allowbreak taint of t'\allowbreak blood and not pass it on to their offspring, although this is probably wishful thinking. An area where a briar is buried after \see{death} may be seeded with alien, supernatural foliage. Briars who got buried with vengeance or wrath can particularly affect t'\allowbreak land with this taint, it is therefore recommended to bury dead briars in hedges or on islands surrounded by flowing water. In case of taint, it can often help to clearly delineate a boundary between t'\allowbreak tainted land and t'\allowbreak surroundings, and \see{beating of t'bounds} between them, to keep t'\allowbreak taint at bay.
\paragraph{Britta} “T'Young Empress”, on t'\allowbreak throne 374–376 YE. She died in \see{battle} against t'\allowbreak \see{thule} at t'\allowbreak autumn equinox 276, alongside large parts of t'\allowbreak Empire's heros of her time.
\paragraph{Brock's toll} a famous toll bridge. T'road that this bridge lies on carries most of t'\allowbreak agricultural traffic between Dawn and t'\allowbreak Marches, and t'\allowbreak operator of t'\allowbreak Toll is allowed by tradition to claim one sack from each cart's load. T'bridge is so old that when it was first constructed t'\allowbreak Vallorn still controlled most of Miaren. In t'\allowbreak early days of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} this site changed hands between t'\allowbreak two \see{nation}s several times, often with violence. Even when Earls and Stewards forbade their people to fight, rowdy yeomen would often take matters into their own hands and t'\allowbreak navarr soon became sick of breaking up scuffles over ownership. Eventually t'\allowbreak Imperial Senate took matters into their own hand and decreed that ownership of t'\allowbreak Toll would be decided by an annual competition of arms between t'\allowbreak yeoman who were so eager to fight. Eventually this evolved into t'\allowbreak modern practice of Brock's Buffet – a brutal (nonlethal) five-aside melee each summer, with only one winner left standing to claim ownership for t'\allowbreak coming year. T'Buffet has traditionally been won by t'\allowbreak Marches, and for it's current owner, it's also kent as “Bobby Shanks' bridge”.
\paragraph{burial} rite after \see{death}. Marcher \see{hearth magick} requires that dead Marchers be buried in Marcher soil, to feed back into t'\allowbreak cycle of \see{Prosperity}. In addition to t'\allowbreak Marches themselves, there is an orchard in \see{holberg} that was turned into Marcher soil to bury a large number of dead Marchers that could not be brought home. \proverb{Sow, tend and reap; fight, toil and weep.}

\paragraph{Chalk Downs} a chalky region in t'\allowbreak northern \see{Mournwold}, held by t'\allowbreak \see{jotun}.
\paragraph{chirurgeon} someone with basic training in \see{medicine}, able to stabilise someone to stop them from \see{bleeding out} from a mortal \see{injury}. \proverb{Healer's faults grow orchards.}
\paragraph{citizen} t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, according to its wise \see{constitution}, “recognize[s] as citizens those whose oath to accept t'\allowbreak culture of a \see{nation}; to honour t'\allowbreak \see{virtue}s of t'\allowbreak way, and to support t'\allowbreak \see{law}s of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, is accepted by [an] egregore [such as \see{Jack-in-the-green}].” citizens are guaranteed “dignity, freedom, and Prosperity.” citizens must fulfil their obligations to t'\allowbreak state and in return they receive associated rights, including protection under Imperial \see{law}. Individuals who have forsworn t'\allowbreak oath to their egregore will be considered \see{foreigner}s, not \see{barbarian}s.
\paragraph{civil service} t'\allowbreak members of t'\allowbreak civil service, after long training in t'\allowbreak Castle of Thorns in \see{Dawn}, are in charge of keeping t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} running. Non-\see{magistrate} civil servants wear a golden \see{horse} head on purple.
\paragraph{clemency} when a person who is charged with a \see{crime} comes to t'\allowbreak \see{trial} they have a choice – to plead guilty or not guilty. If, and only if, they plead guilty then they may ask for a priest (or t'\allowbreak empress) to plead for clemency on grounds of \see{virtue} on their behalf. T'magistrate reinholz has written a longer essay to aid priests provide a helpful plead for clemency. Normally t'\allowbreak accused will have been given time before t'\allowbreak trial to find a priest, to make their confession and to explain their actions, and to be \see{shriven}. No priest is obliged to make a plea for clemency. If t'\allowbreak priest accepts this duty, they should take care to examine t'\allowbreak facts of t'\allowbreak case in detail. T'priest must then use their own judgement of t'\allowbreak \see{virtue}s of t'\allowbreak act in question. They will be called as a witness to present a short plea for clemency to t'\allowbreak court. Precisely how t'\allowbreak priest deals with this is entirely up to t'\allowbreak priest – indeed if t'\allowbreak priest feels there is no virtue in t'\allowbreak act then there is nothing wrong with t'\allowbreak plea stating exactly that. If pleading clemency, priests should be aware that they will need to persuade t'\allowbreak magistrate as to t'\allowbreak virtues of t'\allowbreak act in question. T'magistrate is looking for facts which substantiate t'\allowbreak defendant's actions as being virtuous. They are interested in t'\allowbreak actual reasons in t'\allowbreak mind of t'\allowbreak defendant at t'\allowbreak time of, and before t'\allowbreak crime (rather than rationalisations afterwards). Talking about t'\allowbreak motivation of t'\allowbreak defendant may well help t'\allowbreak plea by demonstrating t'\allowbreak argument within t'\allowbreak defendant's mind about t'\allowbreak virtues of t'\allowbreak act. Magistrates more likely to follow arguments which satisfactorily address t'\allowbreak following sorts of issues: 1) why was due process unable to deal with t'\allowbreak situation? 2) why did t'\allowbreak burden fall upon this individual? 3) was t'\allowbreak crime proportionate to t'\allowbreak burden? \proverb{Every wife has two husbands and every husband two wives.}
\paragraph{conclave} t'\allowbreak governing body for all \see{magick}al business in t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}. It can eg. declare \see{amity} or \see{enmity} with \see{eternal}s, or officially declare someone a \see{sorcerer}.

\paragraph{Courage} a \see{virtue}
\paragraph{coven} a group of magickians who join to cast \see{ritual}s together. A coven can only have members from one \see{nation}, and t'\allowbreak number of rituals they can cast together is limited, usually to two rituals per day.
\paragraph{crime}\see{law} Imperial \see{law} distinguishes between crimes against a person (eg. murder, or assault), crimes of property (eg. theft, or possession of \see{poison}s), crimes of position (eg. treason), crimes against t'\allowbreak processes of t'\allowbreak state (eg. subverting agencies of t'\allowbreak state), and religious crimes (eg. \see{blasphemy}, or \see{heresy}). Civil claims are not crimes, but can still be heard by a magistrate in a \see{trial}. \proverb{What happens in t'\allowbreak Marches stays in t'\allowbreak Marches!}
\paragraph{cromlech}  a circle of \see{standing stone}s, often at a \see{regio}.
\paragraph{crown} 1: A piece of regal headgear. 2: A denomination of coins. One crown is worth 20 \see{ring}s, or $^1/_8$ of a \see{throne}. T'annual tax for every \see{citizen} who owns a personal resource allocated by t'\allowbreak \see{civil service} is one crown, according to t'\allowbreak constitution.
\paragraph{crystal mana} \see{mana} in a form that allows it to be used for \see{ritual}s and spellcasting, generally not used for spellcasting. There are various forms of crystals, usually accompanied by a certificate.
\paragraph{curse} using magick on another person is never in and of itself a \see{crime}, but t'\allowbreak \see{conclave} can declare offenders \see{sorcerer}s. Removing a curse is a significant indicating; rituals to remove a curse effect will almost always be many magnitudes higher than t'\allowbreak magnitude of t'\allowbreak ritual that created t'\allowbreak curse. In most cases, a specific ritual or a minimum magnitude will be necessary. Each curse is unique, and t'\allowbreak method of removing it also tends to be unique. T'priestly ceremony of \see{insight} and t'\allowbreak \see{ritual} bright lantern of ophis can help discern t'\allowbreak nature of t'\allowbreak curse and how to deal with it. Some curses can also be removed by t'\allowbreak intervention of a powerful creature or item, such as t'\allowbreak \see{eternal} \see{Ephisis}. Like rituals there is no single \see{eternal} with t'\allowbreak power to remove just any curse, rather specific creatures or items have t'\allowbreak ability to remove a specific curse. Powerful creatures almost invariably require quests or favours in return for removing a curse, and gaining their assistance or access to a powerful item are likely to involve difficult quests. Many curses in \see{Imperial lore} contain a pronouncement of doom, which makes it obvious to t'\allowbreak target that they have been put under a curse. It is advisable to consult t'\allowbreak Imperial lore about these. T'following table contains an overview curses that are not delivered through such a pronouncement, or may require urgent reaction. \begin{table*}\centering \begin{tabular}{p{0.35\textwidth}p{0.18\textwidth}p{0.35\textwidth}} effect& cause& fix\\ \hline seeing only black and white& wraiths& exorcism\\ malignant spirits tormenting a territory, reduced production& winter's ghosts (w50)& wait 3 months\\ territory scoured with terrible thunderstorms& thunderous deluge (sp46)& wait 3 months\\ feeling feverish and unwell; skin constantly itches.

\paragraph{Dawn} nation west of t'\allowbreak Marches. T'Marches were formed by yeomen Marching in t'\allowbreak rebel march out of dawn, carving their own place in t'\allowbreak world. Marcher dislike of Dawn is a strong part of Marcher \see{hearth magick}, similar in nature to t'\allowbreak rivalries between siblings, \see{household}s, territories, etc. within t'\allowbreak nation. \proverb{Bread without spice is better than spice without bread.}
\paragraph{day} 1: a time 2: t'\allowbreak \see{magick}al realm of spirit and ken
\paragraph{death} through old age, hunger, or through bleeding out if a mortal \see{injury} has been left untreated for too long, among other things, a man or woman can die. Their \see{soul} will then leave t'\allowbreak body for t'\allowbreak \see{labyrinth}, from whence it will return in due season. A \see{friar}, \see{monk} or other priest will ken t'\allowbreak rites to help a dying Marcher hasten their way through t'\allowbreak \see{labyrinth}. If at all possible, it is desirable that t'\allowbreak dying Marcher be \see{shriven} before their soul leaves t'\allowbreak body, so that they go to t'\allowbreak labyrinth with fewer \see{sin}s, to return faster. In general, a Marcher should always be buried in Marcher soil, either under an existing apple tree or with t'\allowbreak seeds for a new tree. Due to t'\allowbreak \see{taint} that dead \see{briar}s can bring to t'\allowbreak land, it is advisable to give these lineaged a resting place in \see{hedges} or on islands surrounded by flowing water instead. If no priest is at hand to say t'\allowbreak rites for t'\allowbreak burial, t'\allowbreak congregation should speak of t'\allowbreak \see{virtue}s of t'\allowbreak dead, and say such \see{proverbs} as exemplify t'\allowbreak turning of t'\allowbreak circle.\proverb{Spring follows winter, dawn follows night, life follows death.}
\paragraph{declaration} a decision of t'\allowbreak \see{conclave} %\proverb{Dine at Tyke's! You can eat anywhere.}
\paragraph{dedicate} for t'\allowbreak average citizen of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, it is simply enough to ken of t'\allowbreak seven \see{virtue}s and how they apply to their lives. There is no requirement to honour one above another for all seven are part of t'\allowbreak way and will guide their spirit through t'\allowbreak labyrinth of ages. Priests of t'\allowbreak way have made greater study of t'\allowbreak mysteries and doctrines of t'\allowbreak faith. They provide guidance to citizens about how to live virtuously and have learned ceremonies that enrich t'\allowbreak lives of virtuous citizens and enhance an individual’s understanding of t'\allowbreak \see{virtue}s. T'liao ceremony of dedication allows a human to more sharply focus their spirit onto one particular virtue path. This focus enables a dedicated priest to perform other ceremonies that provide greater insight and illumination into t'\allowbreak virtue. Consequently, dedication is reasonably common amongst priests who wish to provide ministry and guidance relating to a specific virtue, whilst other priests choose not to dedicate and so represent all seven virtues equally. While dedication does not aid reincarnation by itself, some layfolk do choose to become dedicated for their own reasons. Such individuals are called pilgrims. \proverb{Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms.}
\paragraph{desecration} t'\allowbreak religious \see{crime} of removing spontaneously created auras such as legacies of ascendance to \see{paragon}hood. This includes such auras arising on areas, objects and people.
\paragraph{doctrine} t'\allowbreak doctrines of t'\allowbreak faith represent t'\allowbreak correct understanding of t'\allowbreak way. They have been debated, analysed and formally recognised by t'\allowbreak synod. Teaching doctrines that are at odds with, and thus undermine, t'\allowbreak doctrines of t'\allowbreak faith is as heresy and thus a religious crime under t'\allowbreak \see{law}.\begin{table*} \begin{tabular}{p{0.8\textwidth}}\emph{T'Human Spirit is immortal}.

\paragraph{dolmen} a table made of two or more \see{standing stone}s with a slab on top \begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/dolmen}\caption[Dolmen*]{Dolmen near Pickham, Upwold*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{dragonbone} a clay-like soft material found near t'\allowbreak roots of living trees, generally symbolised by a dragon's head. Used by magicksmiths to create \see{magickal item}s that affect bonds or t'\allowbreak spirit.
\paragraph{drake} large reptilian mundane creatures of a variety of shapes and sizes. They are usually predatory, and while t'\allowbreak majority are man-sized or smaller there are a few uncommon breeds that are larger than a man. They are unkent in t'\allowbreak cold north of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}.
\paragraph{drakes} t'\allowbreak first marcher army, named after t'\allowbreak first general, \see{Tom Drake}. Composed mostly of well-equipped \see{Mitwold}er yeomen.\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Drakes}\caption{Drakes emblem}\end{figure}
\paragraph{druj} \see{barbarian} orcs well-versed in using herbal \see{poison}s and \see{potion}s, and creating auras of \see{fear}. On t'\allowbreak battlefield t'\allowbreak druj strive to project a terrifying image. They usually wear dark colours, suitable for hiding in bogs and swamps, often with hints of dark green and yellow.
\paragraph{dwile flinging} a \see{sport} from t'\allowbreak area of \see{Greywater}. T'game involves of two teams, each taking a turn to dance around t'\allowbreak other while attempting to avoid an ale-soaked cloth, t'\allowbreak dwile, flung by t'\allowbreak non-dancing team. T'jobbernoll (referee) awards points based on body parts hit by t'\allowbreak dwile.
\paragraph{eastern guard} a fortification in \see{Birchland} in \see{Upwold}, originally built against \see{Dawn} and \see{vallorn}spawn from Miaren. T'brooding towers and crenelated walls were built early in t'\allowbreak history of t'\allowbreak Marches in Birchland, on impetus of \see{Joshua Benson}'s tower at Pickham. T'castle is a popular stopping place for merchants travelling through t'\allowbreak central \see{Empire}, but still battle ready at all times, for one never kens when an attack may come from an unexpected direction. 
\paragraph{Empire} T'republic founded by t'\allowbreak \see{first Empress} on t'\allowbreak idea of uniting humanity to bring ken of t'\allowbreak way and of t'\allowbreak true \see{virtue}s to every human (and, by current understanding, every other) soul. Composed of ten \see{nation}s tied together by one \see{throne} and \see{constitution}, and surrounded by heathen neighbours, t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} is humanity's Civilization's only hope.
\paragraph{enchantment} a lasting \see{magick}al effect, often produced by a ritual. Every target can only be under one enchantment at a time, though for example an enchantment of a farm can also affect t'\allowbreak yeoman who owns it.
\paragraph{enmity} (do not confuse with \see{amity}) means that an \see{eternal} is considered an enemy of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, just as a \see{barbarian}. Aiding such an individual is a \see{crime}.
\paragraph{Ephisis} \see{autumn} \see{eternal} of ethical trade, good barter and fair exchange, preferably of actual material things (though this includes skill and time, including for mediation). She is kent for t'\allowbreak security of her vaults and her dislike of curses. T'eternal herself has never been seen, but trade with her is also possible through t'\allowbreak \see{ritual} Ephisis' Scale [autumn \see{magnitude} 4]
\paragraph{eternal} Do your homework before messing with eternals! eternals are lord of a domain in a \see{magick}al realm. Eternals and can be considered enemies of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} (\see{barbarian}) when under enmity, or \see{foreigner}s when under amity. Unless under special circumstances, a citizen is far fore likely to encounter \see{herald}s of eternals than t'\allowbreak eternals themselves.  They are alien, powerful and well documented creatures. For t'\allowbreak eternals seen around Anvil, politeness is usually sufficient to navigate an encounter.
\paragraph{exemplar} An exemplar is an individual demonstrating exceptional \see{virtue}, and fulfilling at least 4 of t'\allowbreak 8 signs of t'\allowbreak \see{paragon}, but without doctrinal status. While exemplarhood may be t'\allowbreak first step to transcendence, t'\allowbreak exemplar is defined above all by their capacity to inspire. T'synod has recognized two exemplars in t'\allowbreak Marches, t'\allowbreak legendary folk heroine \see{Bolstering Bill} of \see{Loyalty} and \see{Pickham}'s \see{Joshua Benson}, exemplar of \see{Vigilance}.
\paragraph{faith} t'\allowbreak proven belief in t'\allowbreak seven \see{virtue}s guiding t'\allowbreak soul through t'\allowbreak \see{labyrinth} unites t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}.
\paragraph{farm} if a landskeeper does not ken how to run a farm, this is not t'\allowbreak document to teach them. Farm rituals (blessing of t'\allowbreak new spring; strong ox, golden sun; gathering t'\allowbreak harvest) can be found in t'\allowbreak \see{appendix}.
\paragraph{fear} fear is a false \see{virtue}. Some barbarians, such as t'\allowbreak \see{druj}, can create auras of supernatural fear, which can only be countered through supernatural means, such as t'\allowbreak banner of t'\allowbreak bold (\see{magick}al items), hallows of items, individual anointment, or, for a short leap of bravery, heroic might or t'\allowbreak mental disposition of \see{lineaged}. \proverb{Fear is worse than fighting.}
\paragraph{feast for t'crows} a dangerous and very specific antidote for illegal \see{poison}s.
\paragraph{Feni} t'\allowbreak Feni are primitive human \see{barbarian}s from wild places of t'\allowbreak Marches. They paint their bodies in colour and, almost always with drowned greens and dirty yellows. They make extensive use of camouflage, which makes it easy for them to hide and to attack from ambush, which they do frequently. Inbred and backwards, Feni mostly keep to themselves, but at semi-regular intervals they lead raids into t'\allowbreak Marches, as well as southern Wintermark and t'\allowbreak northern brass coast. In these savage raids, they thieve everything they can get away with, and kill anyone who wants to prospect their hard-earned \see{Prosperity}. They dress primitively, using only leather and fur, and use spears and javelins, because they lack fundamental aspects of civilization, such as metal work. T'\see{Applewood} levy is a community of \see{household}s that banded together after a particularly brutal raid by t'\allowbreak Feni.
\paragraph{first Empress} T'first Empress was Highborn, and t'\allowbreak last to ride a legendary Highborn \see{horse}. After taking \see{liao}, she revealed that all human souls are re-incarnated on t'\allowbreak same wheel, regardless of whether they were Highborn. She thus began steps to start t'\allowbreak formation of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} such that Highborn reborn elsewhere would still come to know their heritage and t'\allowbreak Way of \see{virtue}. From Highborn faith, t'\allowbreak Empire came into being, changing t'\allowbreak face of t'\allowbreak world forever.
\paragraph{Fisher’s Rock} a black stone mound that emerges from t'\allowbreak middle of t'\allowbreak fens near \see{Greywater}, \see{Bregasland}. Atop it is a ruined tower ascribed to t'\allowbreak \see{Sentinel}. It is said to be haunted, often showing strange lantern lights that lead people astray in t'\allowbreak fens. T'area around t'\allowbreak rock sometimes yields treasures – old cups, coins, or sometimes more significant artefacts. As a result, many of t'\allowbreak local clannish \see{merrow} spend their time as prospectors; although they are as likely to return bloated with poison and on t'\allowbreak brink of death as they are to return with something of interest. 
\paragraph{foot-t'-ball} a famous Marcher \see{sport}, in which two teams try to get a ball t'\allowbreak size of a pig's bladder to a goal in t'\allowbreak other team's field. Weapons other than sticks no longer than a forearm are not permitted in play, and any \see{injury}, traumatic or otherwise, is usually quickly remedied by t'\allowbreak \see{physick}s on t'\allowbreak field.
\paragraph{foreigner} broadly, foreigners are any person who is neither a citizen nor a barbarian. Foreigners are subject to t'\allowbreak \see{law} and are accorded protection by it as if they were a citizen, but they do not otherwise enjoy t'\allowbreak benefits of citizenship. However, \see{eternal}s, and t'\allowbreak \see{herald}s of eternals, are not treated as foreigners (thereby receiving protection under t'\allowbreak law) unless they are t'\allowbreak subject of a declaration of \see{amity} made by t'\allowbreak Imperial conclave. If a citizen forswears their oath to their egregore and thereby ceases to be a citizen they become a foreigner (and so still benefit from t'\allowbreak protection of t'\allowbreak law). Citizens and former citizens who fight against t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} will be given \see{trial}s for their crimes, rather than be treated as barbarians, if feasible. \begin{figure*}\centering\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{encyclopedia/worldmap}\caption{t'Empire and its neighbours}\end{figure*}
\paragraph{Forte Fidelis} old asavean for Faithful to t'\allowbreak Luck. A fortification around \see{Hay} in \see{Mitwold}.
\paragraph{freeborn} an inhabitant of t'\allowbreak \see{brass coast}.
\paragraph{Freemoor} a region in t'\allowbreak northern \see{Mournwold}, held by t'\allowbreak \see{jotun}.
\paragraph{friar} a pilgrim who has made following t'\allowbreak way and teaching t'\allowbreak \see{virtue}s his purpose in life. Often addressed as “brother” or “sister”.
\paragraph{Golden Downs} t'\allowbreak region around \see{Hay} in \see{Mitwold}, containing t'\allowbreak garrison \see{Forte Fidelis}.
\paragraph{Good Walder} \see{paragon} of \see{Prosperity}. Probably an early \see{landskeeper}. Usually depicted with a club and a straw mask.\begin{figure} \centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Walder} \caption{Good Walder*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{grand market} a market in \see{Meade} which takes place on t'\allowbreak third weekend of each month and attracts traders from across t'\allowbreak Marches and even occasionally from Wintermark to t'\allowbreak north. 
\paragraph{granite} \see{white granite}
\paragraph{Gravenmarch} t'\allowbreak region around \see{Graven} in \see{Bregasland}.
\paragraph{Graven} \see{market town} in \see{Bregasland}. Graven grew rich from Graven Rock, its high fields and mineral wealth. In happier times t'\allowbreak \see{navarr} came here often, with news and trade-goods from far afield. Many's t'\allowbreak inhabitant here who started life far, far away, brought here by a navarr Guide. Nowadays, it’s t'\allowbreak base of supply for t'\allowbreak castles and forts that defend Bregasland against t'\allowbreak \see{jotun} in t'\allowbreak \see{Mournwold} and t'\allowbreak forests of Liathaven.
\paragraph{green iron} a gray metal, generally symbolised by a sword. Used by magicksmiths to create dyes or lightwight \see{magickal item}s that offer protection.
\paragraph{Green March} a region in t'\allowbreak \see{Mournwold}, held by t'\allowbreak \see{jotun}.
\paragraph{Greensward} t'\allowbreak region around \see{Overton} in t'\allowbreak \see{Mournwold}, t'\allowbreak only region in t'\allowbreak Mourn held by t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}. Can also refer to t'\allowbreak Overton Monastery.
\paragraph{grendel} orcs who hail from lands to t'\allowbreak south and east of t'\allowbreak \see{Bay of Catazar}. A nation of sea-faring orcs with a love for wealth and power, they were once nothing but \see{pirate}s and reavers. Over time their society has advanced to t'\allowbreak point where they are as likely to trade as to steal what they want. Despite t'\allowbreak luxurious lifestyle of their leaders, t'\allowbreak \keyword{Salt Lords}, t'\allowbreak Grendel are brutal, uncompromising bullies who use violence and threats of violence to get what they want. On t'\allowbreak field of \see{battle}, t'\allowbreak grendel field mercenary orc tribes, as well as their own elite moridun.
\paragraph{Grey Fens} T'region around Greywater in Bregasland.
\paragraph{Greywater} village in \see{Bregasland}, t'\allowbreak furthest west any wise Marcher will go. T'locals make their living primarily from eel-fishing, but since this isn’t a trade that leads to many exports, some of t'\allowbreak more daring amongst them will scour t'\allowbreak surrounding marsh for unusual plants and flowers. These are dried, and sold through t'\allowbreak markets at Meade. T'local grey water is not t'\allowbreak best water to drink, so there's a thriving market in pure water.
\paragraph{hallow} a ceremony that gives a magickal item an aura of \see{virtue}, affecting everyone bound to t'\allowbreak item.
\paragraph{hat} a fundamental piece of Marcher garment \proverb{I'll just go and put my hat on.}
\paragraph{Hay} a small rural town set amongst rolling field in southern \see{Mitwold}, near t'\allowbreak border to t'\allowbreak \see{jotun}-occupied \see{Mournwold}. “T'golden fields of Hay” appear in many a Marcher song.
\paragraph{headpant} also kent as “coif”, a piece of garment worn on t'\allowbreak head. Worn under a hat or helmet, it can prevent chafing.
\paragraph{hearth magick} is a low-key everyday type of magick that keeps us being safe and prosperous. It is also important for keeping t'\allowbreak \see{Jack-in-chains} bound. Important elements of Marcher hearth magick are t'\allowbreak appropriate burial of Marchers in Marcher soil after \see{death} (cf. \see{holberg}), and many elements of tradition, such as \see{poppet}s and seasonal festivals, grant t'\allowbreak Marchers persistent Prosperity through hearth magick.\proverb{T'answer lies in t'\allowbreak soil.}
\paragraph{hearth tithe} an ancient tradition in t'\allowbreak Marches and \see{Wintermark}, where farmers diversify their farms to grow \see{herb}s in addition to food to support their communities in times of war. T'practice largely fell out of practice during t'\allowbreak Second Interregnum. It was common for \see{monk}s to encourage t'\allowbreak observation of t'\allowbreak Hearth Tithe. A \see{monastery} would often receive donations of herbs from t'\allowbreak surrounding farms to be used in support of t'\allowbreak wider community. T'practice has not been widely observed for over a century, but was reintroduced in t'\allowbreak year 379.
\paragraph{Heath} a region in \see{Upwold}, containing t'\allowbreak \see{Sutton quarries} and bordering t'\allowbreak \see{Mournwold}.
\paragraph{hedges} a line of shrubs and important marker of t'\allowbreak boundaries (\see{beater}) of fields and communities. As of new, it has become a tradition to bury dead \see{briar}s in t'\allowbreak brambles of hedges. \proverb{A hedge between keeps a friendship green.}
\paragraph{hedge wizard} a \see{magick} user whose main \see{Loyalty} is a single \see{household}, not t'\allowbreak whole of t'\allowbreak Marches.
\paragraph{Hepton bridge} Some of t'\allowbreak worst fighting of t'\allowbreak short-lived \see{Marcher civil war} took place in western Upwold; one of t'\allowbreak few pitched battles between t'\allowbreak supporters of t'\allowbreak \see{first Empress} and those households who opposed t'\allowbreak formation of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} took place here at Hepton Bridge. Perhaps t'\allowbreak bloodiest conflict of t'\allowbreak civil war, t'\allowbreak scrubby heathland of t'\allowbreak battlefield is largely given a wide berth except by occasional pilgrims of Loyalty who come here to muse on t'\allowbreak spiritual significance of t'\allowbreak ancient conflict that set cousins against one another. 
\paragraph{herald} More human, both physically and socially, servitors of t'\allowbreak \see{eternal}s. These can be recognised by their alien forms (Heralds usually show strong signs of lineage or similar exotic features such as beaks, horns, feathers etc.) and their detection under magick.  Nearly every herald encountered within t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} will belong to an eternal under \see{amity} and be considered a \see{foreigner}, because protective magick makes it hard for other heralds to enter this realm. They will generally be honest about their master. They will exhibit character traits consistent with their master. They can be powerful creatures and unless you ken better should be treated with a similar respect to a stranger in t'\allowbreak inn. You ken, t'\allowbreak one that you're not sure whether they will stab you in t'\allowbreak alley, bring news from a far away place or offer trades that greatly benefit you.
\paragraph{herb} in addition to herbs useful in cookery and brewing, Imperial herb gardens grow five herbs with important applications in \see{medicine}. \begin{table} \begin{tabular}{p{0.6\textwidth}} blue mazzarine to save a limb\\ grey bladeroot stems a weakness dim\\ red roseweald venom’s power breaks\\ true vervain body's healing wakes\\ though marrowort takes soldiers' pain\\ at battle's end they'll fall again\\ \end{tabular}\caption{medical herbs}\end{table}
\paragraph{herding cats} a fine skill for any landskeeper.
\paragraph{heresy} t'\allowbreak religious \see{crime} of willfully rejecting, or perverting, t'\allowbreak orthodox doctrines of t'\allowbreak faith as laid down by t'\allowbreak Imperial synod, or actively teaching and promoting false doctrines.
\paragraph{high Courage} a monument in t'\allowbreak \see{Green March} near t'\allowbreak border with \see{Bregasland}. Looking down across t'\allowbreak moors towards Liathaven, it is a large statue of a stag with broken antlers, ascribed to t'\allowbreak people of Terunael (who later became t'\allowbreak \see{navarr}). On a stone block at t'\allowbreak base of t'\allowbreak statue letters simply read “High Courage” but it is clear that they are more recent than t'\allowbreak statue itself. \begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/highcourage}\caption{high Courage*}\end{figure}\footnotetext{by Frank C. Müller}
\paragraph{highguard} t'\allowbreak \see{nation} that created t'\allowbreak Imperial \see{faith}.
\paragraph{holberg} t'\allowbreak easternmost city of t'\allowbreak \see{League}, notable for containing small enclave of Marcher soil in t'\allowbreak League, where Marchers were put to rest. T'establishment was necessary because t'\allowbreak bodies had been animated through a \see{winter} \see{ritual} to fight in t'\allowbreak liberation of t'\allowbreak city from t'\allowbreak \see{druj}, which interfered with Marcher \see{hearth magick} concerning \see{death} and awoke \see{Jack-in-chains}.
\paragraph{horse} an extinct four-legged draft animal and mount, symbol of \see{Loyalty} and t'\allowbreak whole \see{Empire}. T'fleet settling highguard carried with them a great herd of horses, but mismanagement and greed led to their exctinction about t'\allowbreak time of t'\allowbreak foundation of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}. T'\see{first Empress} was t'\allowbreak last owner of a proud war horse, and so t'\allowbreak horse has become a symbol of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}.\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Horse}\caption{horse (reconstruction)*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{household} a group of \see{yeomen} and supporting people, such as \see{friar}s, \see{magicksmith}s and \see{hedge wizard}s, from t'\allowbreak same area who have selected one of theirs to act as their \see{steward}. They are bound by their \see{Loyalty} to each other because they have common economic, political or military interests.
\paragraph{hunger} is a sign of lack of \see{Prosperity}. Unfortunate Marchers are welcome to help themselves to t'\allowbreak fruits of t'\allowbreak grave-orchards, and many places such as monasteries give support to increase t'\allowbreak Prosperity of downtrodden Marcher folk. In Anvil, hunger can be alleviated by dining at tyke’s.\proverb{He who lives on hope, dies of hunger.}
\paragraph{husk} an animated corpse, eg. created by \see{winter} magick or \see{vallorn}. May need \see{burial} (cf. \see{holberg}).
\paragraph{idolatry}t'religious \see{crime} of subsuming human will and destiny to any inhuman entity or force. This includes t'\allowbreak worship, veneration or exaltation of any such being or power.
\paragraph{ilium} star metal, a valuable material with strong magickal properties. One of t'\allowbreak four strategical Imperial resources, distributed by t'\allowbreak bourse. Ilium can make magick effects permanent.
\paragraph{Imperial lore} t'\allowbreak collected body of formulaic \see{ritual}s generally kent throughout t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}. Every magickian has enough passing familiarity with t'\allowbreak rituals associated with their \see{lore} to contribute to one of these, even when they have not \see{mastered} it.
\paragraph{Imperial roseweald} one of t'\allowbreak apothecary \see{herb}s.
\paragraph{injury} there are several different conditions afflicting t'\allowbreak body to differentiate: a general loss in vitality; mortal wounds; terminal conditions; loss of limbs and some more special types of injuries. Other conditions, such as venoms or weakness, are discussed in t'\allowbreak essay on \see{medicine}. Ways of restoring injuries are different for different injuries. A general loss in vitality can be restored by a physick using a dram of true vervain or with time and tools at hand, a stern talking to by a heroic friend, a magickian with t'\allowbreak heal spell, or some \see{potion}s. When a yeoman has lost all their vitality and suffered a mortal wound, causing them to bleed out, they can be helped by t'\allowbreak skills of any basic chirurgeon, or any other way to restore vitality (save not a stern, but an encouraging heroic companion). An individual who has lost all their vitality and has lost too much blood to ever recover should have no hope return to this life, but they may still be able to talk, and a skilled physick can relieve them of their pain. Destroyed limbs can be restored by a physick with access to a dram of cerulean mazzarine, a magickian with t'\allowbreak restore limb spell or t'\allowbreak apothecary's ossean balm (blue as mazzarine). Other, more serious injuries and traumatic wounds need t'\allowbreak attention of a skilled physick to be restored in a lengthy process, but a dram of marrowort can temporarily relieve t'\allowbreak pain. 
\paragraph{inquisition} a formal process through which t'\allowbreak \see{synod} assesses how virtuous or unvirtuous an individual or group is. An individual or group may only be subjected to inquisition once per summit. Whoever faces inquisition must come to a designated location at a set time. T'duration of t'\allowbreak inquisition is one hour, which can be extended by a \see{magistrate}. Refusing to participate in an inquisition can be ground for escalation to condemnation, t'\allowbreak lack of co-operation will be taken into consideration by t'\allowbreak magistrate and might be considered a \see{crime} against t'\allowbreak processes of state. An inquisiting priest may call for a condemnation, which does not count as raising another synod judgement but is an extension of t'\allowbreak inquisition, and will lead to a \see{trial} according to t'\allowbreak \see{law}.
\paragraph{insight} a priestly ceremony that allows a \see{friar} to discern a mark on someone's soul.
\paragraph{iridescent gloaming} t'\allowbreak wax from iridescent butterfly cocoons, generally symbolised by a butterfly. Used as colouring agent by magicksmiths who create \see{magickal item}s to enhance magick.
\paragraph{iron raptors} a \see{mercenary} bands, undertaking private commissions to remove bandits and monsters for coin and glory. T'iron raptors can sometimes be found in \see{Anvil} looking for desperate yeomen willing to go on their \see{skirmish}es for coin and bounty.
\paragraph{ISoM} t'\allowbreak Imperial school of \see{medicine}, founded upon Marcher initiative, runs t'\allowbreak anvil field hospital. Anyone with an eager interest in t'\allowbreak medical arts of a chirurgeon, physick or apothecary will find much more intensive discussion of those matters in their wise library than in this loyal compendium.
\paragraph{Jack-in-chains} t'\allowbreak dark mirror of t'\allowbreak Marcher egregore \see{Jack-in-the-green}. Same name as an evil giant from a children's story, also kent as Jack-of-Irons or Bloody Jack. Legend has it that Jack-in-chains was tricked into falling down a well and is still buried near \see{Wayford}.
\paragraph{Jack-in-the-green} t'\allowbreak Marcher egregore. As every \see{nation} of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, all Marchers are bound to an egregore. Some generations until 379, t'\allowbreak egregore's spirit inhabited Robert Ramsbruck, a \see{beater}. After he fell in battle fighting a \see{drake}, Jack found a new host in t'\allowbreak herbalist Fern. T'power of Marcher \see{hearth magick} keeps his dark counterpart, t'\allowbreak \see{Jack-in-chains}, bound deep in his core. If Jack-in-chains gets loose, he needs to be bound again by Marchers following their traditions, and innocent \see{soul}s binding him in place, just like in t'\allowbreak old legends we ken of t'\allowbreak Jack-in-chains. T'figures of Jack-in-the-green and Jack-in-chains may actually be older than t'\allowbreak formation of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, for they have been part of legends even when t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} was founded.
\paragraph{Joshua Benson} \see{exemplar} of \see{Vigilance}, recognized by t'\allowbreak \see{synod} in 378. Known as “t'major”. He is usually depicted on top of a tower with a shield, holding watch.\begin{figure} \centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Major} \caption{Joshua Benson*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{jotun} t'\allowbreak jotun are t'\allowbreak tribe of barbarian orcs that have captured t'\allowbreak \see{Mournwold} in 347. They are a warlike tribe that values strength-in-arms and fighting-spirit as their highest \see{virtue}s; they love one-on-one fights, challenged by t'\allowbreak orc pointing at an opponent with their weapon and then raising their head up to show their necks to their opponent. Making a slashing or ripping gesture with their hand as they bring their head down with a snarl. This signal shows that they consider t'\allowbreak person they are looking at as worthy of honourable combat. T'target may return t'\allowbreak challenge, and engage t'\allowbreak jotun in single combat that ends until one warrior cannot continue. jotun will usually accept a surrender unless they have reason to believe they are being tricked in some manner, and often allow injured opponents to retreat. They have also been kent to allow opponents who have fought bravely to gather their dead or injured. Warriors of t'\allowbreak jotun see little honour in killing t'\allowbreak weak or t'\allowbreak unarmed, and prefer to take them as thralls. Thralls are treated reasonably well by t'\allowbreak jotun; as long as they show proper respect to their overlords, they are usually left to their own devices. Many modern jotun thralls are t'\allowbreak descendants of humans taken in battle, and consider t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} their enemy. T'jotun value Courage, strength and martial prowess above other attributes. Their love of battle and emphasis on personal glory and honour, as well as their war-like traditions, means that many jotun warriors are a match one-on-one for their Imperial counterparts. They do not throw their lives away, nor use their subject tribes as disposable troops, but they are invariably looking for a way to increase their honour, with an eye towards becoming ancestors when they die. T'only true dishonour most jotun recognise is showing fear in t'\allowbreak face of t'\allowbreak enemy, or striking a worthy opponent down by treacherous means. jotun favour axes and hammers, both two-handed and coupled with a round shield. They tend to shy away from bows, and seem to have no appreciation for t'\allowbreak crossbow as a weapon of war – when it comes to ranged combat they prefer thrown axes or javelins. T'colour red appears to have totemic significance for t'\allowbreak jotun, and figures on most of their banners. \proverb{Better an honest enemy than a false friend.}
\paragraph{judgement} a decision of t'\allowbreak \see{synod}
\paragraph{Kallavesi} one of t'\allowbreak three traditions of \see{Wintermark}
\paragraph{King's Stoke} \see{market town} in \see{Upwold}, with a tower that existed before t'\allowbreak \see{march}, possibly built by t'\allowbreak \see{Sentinel}.
\paragraph{labyrinth}t'twisting realm of pure spirit that is integral to t'\allowbreak cycle of reincarnation, a core doctrine of t'\allowbreak \see{faith}. T'name is something of a metaphor for no mortal has been there to witness it, but t'\allowbreak journey from death to rebirth is neither simple nor instantaneous. Some spirits are said to wander between lives generations before being reborn, and some are lost forever. T'way of \see{virtue} teaches that living a virtuous life holds t'\allowbreak key to successfully traversing t'\allowbreak labyrinth of ages swiftly, safely and with t'\allowbreak purity of spirit that strengthens ties to past lives.\begin{figure} \centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Labyrinth} \caption{t' labyrinth symbol}\end{figure}
\paragraph{landskeeper} anyone who uses \see{magick} to support t'\allowbreak Marches as a whole and Marcher folklore in particular. Landskeepers can use a variety of methods, from \see{hearth magick} to \see{ritual}s, to do this. Some landskeepers lack education in specific magickal abilities at all, and use traditional rites and offer good advice and aid to t'\allowbreak Marcher folk. Many landskeepers avoid t'\allowbreak conflicting loyalties arising from also being part of a \see{household} and look down on \see{hedge wizard}s who put their Loyalty to a \see{steward} above Loyalty to t'\allowbreak Marches.
\paragraph{landskeeper's oath} T'oaths that landskeepers swear are often carved into a a tree, to bind them to t'\allowbreak land. By extension, a magick staff crafted from such a tree, which can allow a battle magickian landskeeper to bind enemies in place, is called a landskeeper's oath. \proverb{As easy to escape as a landskeeper’s oath.}
\paragraph{Lashonar} \see{night} \see{eternal} of speech and active communication facilitating change, and travel. Heralds of Lashonar often have a bird-like appearance, and many have a reputation for being petty thieves, and tend to view visits to t'\allowbreak mortal realm as an amusing holiday rather than a serious duty. Lashonar delights in speech, be it singing, drama, debates, or rumour; and t'\allowbreak solving of mysteries. It loves to hear secrets, but often finds itself at odds with t'\allowbreak \see{Whisper-Gallery}. While those hoard secrets, Lashonar effectively destroys them by sharing them. 
\paragraph{law} Marcher business is Marcher business, and should be conducted as such. Tradition has means to settle \see{boundary dispute}s, \see{sorcerer}s, and so on. But when individuals from elsewhere are involved in an affair, t'\allowbreak Imperial code of law applies. This is often t'\allowbreak case for events related to a summit in Anvil. Under Imperial law, \see{foreigner}s have t'\allowbreak same protection as \see{citizen}s, though not t'\allowbreak same rights. \see{barbarian}s do not have those rights, quite t'\allowbreak opposite. Imperial law regulates crimes against people, crimes of position, crimes against t'\allowbreak state, civil claims and religious crimes. T'decision on guilt and punishment is made by a magistrate in a \see{trial}. T'corresponding tables list all criminal acts; It is possible for willing participants to give consent so that what would otherwise be crimes being committed against them are not. Attempting, ading or abetting of a crime is equivalent to committing t'\allowbreak crime under t'\allowbreak law. \begin{table*}\begin{tabular}{p{0.15\textwidth}p{0.75\textwidth}} Murder& action against a person with intent to kill them.\\ Manslaughter& against a person which results in someone’s death.\\ Assault& striking a citizen.

\paragraph{liao} a refinement of vinum, used in a priestly \see{ceremony}. T'very rare, pure liao allows citizens to experience visions of past lives.
\paragraph{lineaged} lineage means that a person is touched by one of t'\allowbreak \see{magick}al realms and can occur in many ways. T'table gives an overview of t'\allowbreak types of lineage and their associated realms. Parents with lineage often give birth to children with their lineage, while t'\allowbreak offspring of a human and a \see{herald} is always lineaged. It is also happens that fully human parents give birth to a lineaged child. Lineage can also occur for other reasons, for instance a child born in a primal forest under t'\allowbreak influence of t'\allowbreak realm of spring might become a \see{briar} in later life while a child born during a great famine when winter holds sway might be born a draughir. At certain times, t'\allowbreak flow of magick due to constellation on t'\allowbreak sky can influence t'\allowbreak occurrence of lineaged, either naturally or by making transformative magick easier. Many Marcher households are kent to not include any lineaged, despite appearance to t'\allowbreak contrary – denying t'\allowbreak merrow lineage of a household member by stating that they would be a mere human who is just feeling a bit blue –, or insist, for example, that their good cambions are spirited and energetic, whereas a cambion stranger would be seen as particularly conniving.\begin{table*}\begin{tabular}{lll} name& realm& trappings\\ \hline \see{briar}& spring& bark; volatile, impulsive \& restless behaviour\\ changeling& summer& pointy ears, antlers; bold \& self-confident attitude\\ cambion& autumn& curved horns; opinionated \& driven dominance\\ draughir& winter& pale skin, hollow eyes; cold \& hungry desire\\ \see{merrow}& day& gills, blue mottled skin; calm \& focused distance\\ naga& night& scales; relaxed \& passionate indulgence\end{tabular}\caption{lineages}\end{table*}

\paragraph{magickal item} craftsmen can use t'\allowbreak rare materials orichalchum (o), iridescent gloaming (ig), beggar’s lye (b) ambergelt (a), tempest jade (j) green iron (g), dragonbone (d), weltsilver (w) to create magickal items. Such items retain their special function for 4 seasons, after which they have to be re-charged, essentially creating t'\allowbreak magick again from scratch. It does mostly take a \see{magicksmith} a full month to create an item; for such items as are empowered by skillful application of t'\allowbreak artisan’s craftsmanship alone, and not through t'\allowbreak magickal properties of their materials, it takes a magicksmith 2 full months. Personal magickal items can be armour, weapons or talismans (including shields). A magickian needs to create a bond between t'\allowbreak bearer and t'\allowbreak item, and every citizen can only have one bond of each of t'\allowbreak three types. magick jacks or mithril mail can still be worn under good steel. In addition, a group can have a magickal banner, covenstone or reliquary, and such item can aid every member of t'\allowbreak group. T'late Pete Keeper of \see{King's Stoke} has analysed and composed a selection of inexpensive, useful equipment for t'\allowbreak soldiers of a Marcher household, which is reproduced here for convenience. \begin{table*}\centering\begin{tabular}{p{0.9\textwidth}}{\parindent=-1em bolstering bill: a dying comrade may be saved once a day. 6 g, 7 w.}\\\parindent=-1em  butcher’s bill: cleave a foe in twain or bowl them down once a day. 8 o, 2 ig\\\parindent=-1em  warden’s bardiche (bill): another surge of heroic might. 10g 3 a\\\parindent=-1em  reaving mattock (great weapon): shatter an armament once a day. 7j\\\parindent=-1em  oathkeeper’s bow: another surge of heroic might. 8 g 5 a\\\parindent=-1em  biting blade: this side-sword will cleave a foe mightily once a day. 7 o.\\\parindent=-1em  stoutheart gambeson (light jack): an extra degree of fortitude, slowing t'\allowbreak wearer’s bleeding. 2 months of a magicksmith’s time.\\\parindent=-1em  winter’s breath (light jack): cure three of your wounds once per day. 5w 5a.\\\parindent=-1em  soldier’s harness (light jack): t'\allowbreak yeoman soldier may suffer another blow before she falls. 8a\\\parindent=-1em  mediator’s mail (medium weight): cure three of your wounds with heroic might. 2 months of a magicksmith’s time.\\\parindent=-1em  mithril shirt (medium weight): t'\allowbreak yeoman soldier may suffer another blow before she falls. 2o 4a.\\\parindent=-1em  warrior’s plate (heavy steel): t'\allowbreak yeoman soldier may suffer another blow before she falls. 2 months of a magicksmith’s time.\\\parindent=-1em  phial of t'\allowbreak sun: counts for t'\allowbreak herb of a physick’s choosing, once per day.

\paragraph{magick} mostly refers to what magickians do, but there is also \see{hearth magick}. Every magickian is able to perform three basic magickal effects. Magickians can create bonds between citizens and magickal items or groups (banners, covens or sects) of Imperial citizens bound by a common oath. They can detect and to some extent identify magickal effects such as enchantments on items or individuals they consider, a ritual being cast in their presence, or magickal items. When considering a precise location at t'\allowbreak sentinel gate, they can discern if there is a conjunction to that place; and if so, when it will open; how many people may pass through it; and any special circumstances that related to that conjunction. Finally any magickian can investigate and operate portals such as those bound to regios or t'\allowbreak \see{sentinel gate}, including traveling through, allowing eternals to communicate through, or tracing where they recently opened to. While some magickians extend this number of spells by other useful incantations that mend equipment or problems of \see{medicine} or can be used offensively, many magickians focus on joining covens to cast \see{ritual}s, such as t'\allowbreak mummery plays used to improve productivity of Marcher farms. Rituals always correspond to one of t'\allowbreak realms of magick, which are named (but at most metaphorically related to t'\allowbreak seasons of) \see{winter}, \see{spring}, \see{summer}, \see{autumn}, \see{day} and \see{night}. An overview over rituals a landskeeper might come in contact with is given in an \see{appendix}. For a given problem, a vigilant landskeeper may be well served finding out which realm is likely to be relevant and find an expert on that realm for deeper Wisdom. \proverb{If all you have is crystal mana, every problem looks like a farm.}
\paragraph{magicksmith} an artisan able to produce some manner of \see{magickal item}s from raw \see{materials}.
\paragraph{magistrate} a member of t'\allowbreak \see{civil service} who operates t'\allowbreak legal system, conducting \see{trial}s and overseeing t'\allowbreak application of t'\allowbreak \see{law}. Magistrates usually wear white stolas or vests with a black horse head.
\paragraph{magnitude} is a measure for t'\allowbreak power of of a \see{magick}al ritual. Multiple landskeepers can cast a ritual together if they are in one \see{coven}, but a coven can only cast two rituals per day.
\paragraph{Maiden Downs} region in eastern \see{Mitwold}
\paragraph{Maidenstone} an ancient \see{menhir} in \see{Mitwold}. T'stone stands in a scorched area of land in a grove of ash trees. Every year before t'\allowbreak Spring festival t'\allowbreak farmers of t'\allowbreak area weave t'\allowbreak largest straw dolly kent in t'\allowbreak territories. T'Straw Maiden, as t'\allowbreak creation is kent, is 12 feet tall adorned with wild flowers with intricate patterns of vines woven into her skirt. T'Maiden’s skirt is hollow at t'\allowbreak base and she is placed atop t'\allowbreak menhir. T'Landkeepers of t'\allowbreak area then bless t'\allowbreak Maiden in many nights of ritual. T'Maiden then stands in t'\allowbreak grove, visited by pilgrims who proffer food, trinkets and other offerings at her foot in t'\allowbreak hope that she may bring them some small favour. This continues until t'\allowbreak summer has ended. Mysteriously although t'\allowbreak Maiden has been exposed to all weathers and temperaments, she does not rot, blow away or decay in any way, staying as fresh and brightly golden as t'\allowbreak day she was placed upon t'\allowbreak stone. Then, at t'\allowbreak festival of Harvest there is another ceremony, t'\allowbreak culmination of which sees t'\allowbreak Maiden set alight, burning until there is nothing left. \begin{figure} \centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Maidenstone} \caption{t'Maidenstone}\end{figure}
\paragraph{major} (or mayor) 1. An old \see{Upwold} word for steward 2. \see{Joshua Benson}, examplar of \see{Vigilance}
\paragraph{mana} a unit of magick. A magickian has access to innate mana, which can be used to cast spells. In places with a strong flow of natural magick, rare salts can be made to collect t'\allowbreak magick in t'\allowbreak form of \see{crystal mana} for use in \see{ritual}s.
\paragraph{mandowla} a legendary beast with a sturdy bear-like body with savage talons rather than claws and a head that resembles that of a giant owl with wide eyes and a savage beak. Often found in small family groups, they are omnivores – although with a marked preference for raw meat. They have a predator's cunning and are quite capable of attacking humans if they are disturbed or angered. They are most active at twilight, but have both excellent night vision and keen daylight sight. Common around \see{Upwold}. These creatures are more dangerous than bears simply because they are so ready to attack and kill humans. They do not go out of their way to hunt humans, but if a family moves into an area containing a village, it will need to be dealt with. A small group especially one armed with long pole weapons should be able to bring one to bear and defeat it.
\paragraph{Marches} a nation, bound to t'\allowbreak egregore \see{Jack-in-the-green}. \begin{figure*}\centering\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{encyclopedia/marches}\caption{t'Marches}\end{figure*}
\paragraph{march} t'\allowbreak rebellion of Marcher yeomen leaving Dawn; transferred: becoming a Marcher, by moving to t'\allowbreak territory and accepting its customs, and swearing to t'\allowbreak egregore.
\paragraph{market town} villages in t'Marches large enough to hold regular markets that make t'inhabitants less dependent on their own home-grown supplies. T'biggest and best-known market towns are \see{Meade} in \see{Mitwold}, \see{King's Stoke} and \see{Stockland} in \see{Upwold} and \see{Graven} and \see{Ottery} in \see{Bregasland}. While t'Marches in general land leads to prosperity, in t'market towns, it's often wealth. They are rich, and their wealth brings a power of its own that may prove do be a danger for traditions upheld by smaller t'\see{households} and \see{landskeeper}s. T'\allowbreak first market rights were established by Imperial charter, and towns with these rights are outside t'\allowbreak direct control of t'\allowbreak households. T'\allowbreak Imperial charters prevent a market town being established within a full day's travel of an existing market town. T'\allowbreak inhabitants of a market town appoint \see{aldermen} to represent t'\allowbreak town. In most cases these men or women are wealthy merchants of t'\allowbreak town, but often they include other prominent town folk. Most market towns are small, little more than a few score houses on either side of a main street. At t'\allowbreak heart of almost every prosperous market town is an inn. These large structures are often fortified, with a wall surrounding t'\allowbreak building and adjacent compound. Merchants visiting t'\allowbreak town will usually eat and sleep at t'\allowbreak inn but so will visiting yeomen bringing their goods to market, unless they have relatives who live in t'\allowbreak town. Only Meade is large enough to support more than one inn. \proverb{Prosperity lies in t'soil.}
\paragraph{marshwalker} a large semi-humanoid creature that appears to be made entirely of plant material, coated and held together with thick slime. Primarily found in marshy conditions, such as \see{Bregasland}, t'\allowbreak \see{druj} sometimes bring them along on battles. They are most dangerous when exposed to \see{vallorn}. One problem with marshwalkers is that, in their natural state, they are simply a colony of little slimy blobs that are virtually indistinguishable from t'\allowbreak mud in which they live. In this state they are no threat to anyone, being primarily concerned with eating small insects, fish and plants and splitting into more tiny, nonthreatening blobs. It is only when they feel threatened, when some biological urge inside them decides it is time to move, or when someone starts building a structure near or threatening their habitat that t'\allowbreak colony comes together to assume t'\allowbreak much more dangerous form of a wood-armoured humanoid. Their migrations often take them near human settlements. Attempts to divert a marshwalker exodus are complicated by their resilience, their resistance to fire (they are simply too damp to burn), and their ability to smash through most obstacles placed in front of them. A marshwalker is a major threat to a village, and several marshwalkers might threaten a small town. A well-equipped militia can probably drive a marshwalker off, but are likely to take serious injuries in t'\allowbreak process. A lone character can easily outpace one, and might be able to come up with a cunning way to divert one, but one-on-one will likely be quickly dispatched.

\paragraph{Meade} t'largest settlement in t'\allowbreak Marches, a \see{market town} in Mitwold founded in t'\allowbreak early 3rd century of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}. Crowded around t'\allowbreak mouth of t'\allowbreak eponymous river on t'\allowbreak shores of \see{Westmere}, Meade is not only t'\allowbreak spiritual and administrative heart for t'\allowbreak nation, it's also a port whose ships deal in fishing, trade with foreign nations and sea defence against t'\allowbreak barbarians through Westmere and t'\allowbreak Gullet. It's where Marchers from smaller towns often come to spend hard-earned coin, and more often than not plays host to exotic foreigners. T'Harvest's End Festival sees Meade filled with folk from all across t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, and it's said that no-one sleeps there for a week. In t'\allowbreak wake of t'\allowbreak death of Empress \see{Britta} in 376YE, semi-organised groups of bandits began to prey on traders travelling by land from Meade. By order of t'\allowbreak Imperial Senate, in early 377YE a series of watchtowers and earthworks were constructed around Meade to help address this problem. T'works were overseen by Bridget Eastville née Talbot (senator for Mitwold) as part of a larger plan to provide protection to towns throughout t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}. While t'\allowbreak defences are not sufficient to qualify Meade as a true fortification, they have already helped reduce brigandry throughout t'\allowbreak territory. T'\see{bailiff of t'grand market} has a small office in Meade, although most title holders spend little time there (apart from to oversee t'\allowbreak security of t'\allowbreak grand market on t'\allowbreak third weekend of each month). T'Bailiff is an Imperial title elected each Winter Solstice through t'\allowbreak Imperial Bourse that can be held by any citizen of t'\allowbreak Marches. \proverb{A pig in t'\allowbreak house does not make a farmer}

\paragraph{medicine} there are several afflictions of t'\allowbreak body. In addition to \see{injury}, which is discussed in a separate section, age, venoms, weakness, and other effects can have an influence on a body. T'\see{ISoM}, running t'\allowbreak Anvil field hospital, publishes more in-depths literature on medical matters. For t'\allowbreak vigilant landskeeper, t'\allowbreak conditions of venom and weakness and how to cure them will be most relevant. T'most likely effect of a venom is to dilute t'\allowbreak blood, speeding up bleeding and thus reducing t'\allowbreak time in which a citizen with a mortal wound can still be saved. Such venoms can be cured by a physick using 1 dram of t'\allowbreak \see{herb} Imperial roseweald, by drinking a bloodhallow philtre \see{potion} (a red liquid with white particles), a magickian who has learned t'\allowbreak purify spell, or a \see{day} ritualist using t'\allowbreak \see{ritual} ascetic star of atun (m. 2); bearers of an abraxus stone or under t'\allowbreak effect of t'\allowbreak vitality of rushing water ritual are healed from venom whenever they are healed otherwise. Unnatural weakness can be removed by a physican using one dram of bladeroot, t'\allowbreak feverfail elixir (a flowery, grey sirup), a magickian who has learned t'\allowbreak purify spell, or a summer ritualist casting renewed strength of t'\allowbreak new day (m. 2). \proverb{There is no curing a sick who believes themself to be in health.}
\paragraph{menhir} a singular \see{standing stone}, such as t'\allowbreak \see{Maidenstone}
\paragraph{mercenary} a person who fights for personal gains of money or other recompense instead of fighting for their ideology, nation or similar. In t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, many mercenary groups own a Mercenary Banner, which allows them to partake in \see{battle}s in which t'\allowbreak bulk of their nation is not taking part. T'most famous mercenary groups of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} are t'\allowbreak free companies of t'\allowbreak League, and t'\allowbreak Iron Raptors, a band of wagon riders offering coin and bounty for death or glory missions against bandits or monsters inside t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}.
\paragraph{merrow} a type of \see{lineaged}, touched by t'\allowbreak \see{magick}al realm of \see{day}. They mate and breed just like humans, they have hair, and they give birth to live offspring. Merrow are curious, cold, detatched and can appear too clever by half. Many Marcher merrow live in t'\allowbreak swamps of \see{Bregasland}.
\paragraph{military council} t'\allowbreak gathering of general and/or their adjutants, one of t'\allowbreak five \see{constitution}\-al bodies. Senators are barred from being present at its meetings.
\paragraph{militia} t'\allowbreak militia are vital to t'\allowbreak process of justice in Anvil. They typically perform t'\allowbreak bulk of any investigation work and brief t'\allowbreak magistrates before cases go to \see{trial}. It is a constitutional obligation for a citizen who has been deputised into t'\allowbreak militia to carry out their responsibilities. In practice it would only be in exceptional circumstances that a magistrate would suborn a citizen into t'\allowbreak militia involuntarily. All serving members of t'\allowbreak militia have t'\allowbreak powers and obligations to take reasonable steps to prevent crime and maintain public order; to apprehend those suspected of crime(s) in progress and to bring them before a magistrate; and to report any crimes which require investigating to a magistrate. Magistrates will also appoint members of t'\allowbreak militia to investigate specific crimes (a case). Members of t'\allowbreak militia (and magistrates) may not enter a place of sanctuary without t'\allowbreak express permission of a priest who is responsible for it. Even if permitted to enter they may not arrest or otherwise interfere with anyone within who has been granted sanctuary. An accused may only claim sanctuary for a limited period, usually one hour. This period allows t'\allowbreak accused to make a confession and to ask a priest to attend them at trial so that a plea for clemency can be made on their behalf.
\paragraph{mithril} one of t'\allowbreak four strategical Imperial resources, distributed by t'\allowbreak bourse. Mithril is used to improve mines, mana sites and military units, and to create or supply armies.
\paragraph{Mitwold} t'\allowbreak middle Marcher territory, containing t'\allowbreak large town \see{Meade}. Mitwold's substantial \see{Westmere} coast, populated by small fishing villages along t'\allowbreak shore, gives way to fertile chalk-soiled downs further inland, with rich game-filled woodland and larger farms and market towns beyond. There's gold in t'\allowbreak soil of t'\allowbreak north-western portion of t'\allowbreak nation; t'\allowbreak gold of summer's harvest.
\paragraph{monastery} a \see{household} of \see{friar}s.
\paragraph{monk} a \see{friar} living in a household composed of other \see{friar}s, that is, a \see{monastery}.
\paragraph{motion} a decision of t'\allowbreak \see{senate}
\paragraph{Mournwold} t'\allowbreak southernmost Marcher territory, lost to t'\allowbreak \see{jotun} in 349. Originally t'\allowbreak name referred to t'\allowbreak sound of t'\allowbreak wind in trees and across t'\allowbreak craggy hills. Whearas \see{Upwold} and \see{Mitwold} in particular are kent for their sprawling farms, t'\allowbreak rugged terrain of t'\allowbreak Mourn is perhaps better kent for it's mines. T'hills are riddled with rich veins of green iron, and with mine workings dedicated to extracting that ore. Prior to t'\allowbreak invastion of t'\allowbreak jotun, there had been a growing tide of dissatisfaction among professional miners that all political power had been vested in t'\allowbreak hands of those who owned farms. There were regular complaints that mine owners, like farmers and stewards, owned and worked t'\allowbreak land.
\paragraph{mummers} itinerant bands of actors and dramaturgists. They tend to combine t'\allowbreak practice of \see{ritual} magick with entertainment. Traveling from place to place freely, they attend fairs, markets and other regular gatherings performing plays and feats of skill. They are often greeted with a little suspicion. Some market towns observe local ordinances that ban mummers from spending t'\allowbreak night in their environs.
\paragraph{nation} one of t'\allowbreak 10 composite people of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}: t'\allowbreak Marches, \see{Dawn}, t'\allowbreak \see{League}, \see{Varushka}, \see{Wintermark}, \see{brass coast}, \see{urizen}, \see{navarr}, \see{highguard} and t'\allowbreak Im\-pe\-ri\-al \see{orcs}.

\paragraph{Odd's End} A bustling fishing port with a chip on its shoulder against t'\allowbreak larger Meade, t'\allowbreak fisherfolk of Odd's End Pride themselves on being first out to t'\allowbreak water, t'\allowbreak banner of Odd – a leaping salmon – raised above t'\allowbreak waves before their Meade brethren have untied from dock. Odd was a \see{pilgrim} of \see{Pride}, and founded a monastery here, settling her folk on t'\allowbreak shore when t'\allowbreak Marchers first reached \see{Westmere} and declaring that this would be t'\allowbreak place where she would end her days. 
\paragraph{Ore Hills} A region in t'\allowbreak \see{Mournwold} held by t'\allowbreak \see{jotun}, rich in \see{green iron}.

\paragraph{Our Hills} \see{Ore Hills}
\paragraph{Overton} a garrison town, monastery and fortified manor in \see{Greensward} in t'\allowbreak \see{Mournwold}. Overton was a sheep-farming town and market set on a hill, until it became t'\allowbreak front line of t'\allowbreak war with t'\allowbreak \see{jotun}. It has received strong support from League forces from Tassato. Since t'\allowbreak Senate negotiatied a ceasefire with t'\allowbreak jotun, t'\allowbreak threat that t'\allowbreak armies of barbarians will sweep across Overton is held in abeyance. However, this has not prevented smaller bands of jotun sweeping down into t'\allowbreak valleys of t'\allowbreak Greensward in search of easy riches. In turn, Imperial raiding forces often strike from Overton into t'\allowbreak Mourn.
\paragraph{paragon} an individual that has transcended t'\allowbreak cycle of life and \see{labyrinth} through a life of ultimate \see{virtue}. For t'\allowbreak Marches, \see{Good Walder} has been recognized as paragon of \see{Prosperity}. \begin{table*} \centering \begin{tabular}{ll} inspiration & attracting students, followers or imitators \\ recognition & having been an exemplar in a previous life \\ benevolence & serving t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, in whole or in part \\ pilgrimage & a physical and spiritual journey, purifying t'\allowbreak soul \\ salvation & converting people from their unvirtuous ways \\ legacy & leaving a physical relic \\\hline liberation & transcending t'\allowbreak labyrinth \\ miracles & performing super-human feats \end{tabular}\caption{signs of t'\allowbreak paragon and exemplar}\end{table*}

\paragraph{poison} a dangerous and illegal \see{potion}, such as gutwrench, moon's poison, hunger of t'\allowbreak wolf, t'\allowbreak black gate or t'\allowbreak crimson gate.
\paragraph{pooka} a menacing harvest fey, a black, hairy and horned creature, ranging from as small as a rat to as big as a large goat. while most active in autumn, they are believed to be related to t'\allowbreak realm of \see{spring}. pookas are obsessed with all digestion, from delicious food to farts and piss. They consider part of t'\allowbreak harvest their own. after wassail, in particular after pooka's day on t'\allowbreak first of november, when t'\allowbreak crops are brought in, anything remaining in t'\allowbreak fields is his. any thieves will be punished by amusing t'\allowbreak pooka, through all kinds of uproar in t'\allowbreak digestive system. in some locales, reapers leave a small share of t'\allowbreak crop, pooka's share, to placate t'\allowbreak hungry creature. in exchange, pooka have been kent to aid t'\allowbreak animals on t'\allowbreak farm. \begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Faun}\caption{a poohka farting in t'\allowbreak bramble*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{poppet} every home in t'\allowbreak Marches has at least one straw dolly or poppet, made at t'\allowbreak time of harvest to bring good luck to t'\allowbreak house and ward off evil omens. These intricately twisted and knotted effigies of straw, corn, oats, rye, grass or rushes traditionally bind t'\allowbreak vitality of t'\allowbreak fields and bring their strength into t'\allowbreak home. many marchers carry their own small poppets for protection. in particular, every child is given a straw dolly of their own to help protect them from sickness, and an expectant mother will carry a poppet to ensure t'\allowbreak health of t'\allowbreak child. Touching someone else’s poppet can transfer good and bad between people, and should not be done. when t'\allowbreak season turns again to sowing t'\allowbreak seeds for t'\allowbreak new crop these poppets are laid on t'\allowbreak fields and ploughed back into t'\allowbreak earth, or cast into a bonfire, ensuring a bountiful harvest for t'\allowbreak following year. a landskeeper might employ a poppet in magick that binds or shares vitality or strength, such as granting potence of a band of yeomen. a \see{sorcerer} might use a poppet to steal t'\allowbreak strength of an enemy or an enemy's fields, binding it as they twist and knot t'\allowbreak doll until t'\allowbreak poppet is destroyed or a year has passed. a friar might bind some of t'\allowbreak \see{sin}s of a marcher to a poppet, to be taken away by t'\allowbreak \see{wassail} fire, akin to a \see{wicker man}. To make a simple poppet, take a small bunch of stalks, around 8 inches in length, and strips of wool. fold t'\allowbreak stalks in t'\allowbreak middle, and maybe bind them just below t'\allowbreak fold and tie them tightly. around a half inch to an inch below your first knot, do t'\allowbreak same. split t'\allowbreak bundle into four strands, which will make t'\allowbreak arms and body for your corn poppet. T'middle two will become t'\allowbreak body and t'\allowbreak outer two strands will become t'\allowbreak arms. bend t'\allowbreak stalks that make your corn poppet’s arms and bind carefully with t'\allowbreak strip. Take a longer strip and tie it around t'\allowbreak neck of your poppet. bind t'\allowbreak body pieces together and crisscross strips around t'\allowbreak body. Take strips and tie them around t'\allowbreak base of your corn poppet’s middle and body section. split t'\allowbreak botTom of your poppet to form t'\allowbreak legs, just as you formed t'\allowbreak arms, and bind them. for making a poppet from corn husks, see t'\allowbreak figure.\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/poppet}\caption{making a poppet from corn husks*}\end{figure}

\paragraph{Pride of t'Marches} \see{Mitwold}
\paragraph{Pride} one of t'\allowbreak seven \see{virtue}s. Pride is expressed in representing your past achievements precisely as they are, not diminishing them or embellishing them. T'virtue demands full commitment. \proverb{Pride in small things, Loyalty to great ones.} 
\paragraph{Prosperity} one of t'\allowbreak seven \see{virtue}s. Prosperity lies in t'\allowbreak fine balance of appreciating t'\allowbreak just fruit of hard labour without excess. \proverb{easy come, worth less.}

\paragraph{puca} see \see{pooka}
\paragraph{realm mana} a type of \see{crystal mana} in a form that allows it to be used for a specific \see{realm} of \see{ritual}s.
\paragraph{realm} one of six other planes of existence separate from, but intimately connected to, our world. They are innately connected to t'\allowbreak practice of \see{magick}, as well as being home to magickal entities called \see{eternal}s. magickians have named four of t'\allowbreak realms after seasons, but these are symbolic rather than literal names. T'realm of \see{winter}, for example, incorporates brutal desert, parched forests and bottomless oceans as well as frozen snowfields. T'“seasonal realms” resonate more with t'\allowbreak “seasons of life” than t'\allowbreak literal wheel of t'\allowbreak seasons. \see{spring} is wild and unfettered as a child, \see{summer} is full of t'\allowbreak arrogance of youth, \see{autumn} is a realm of maturity and \see{winter} a realm echoing with t'\allowbreak fear and Wisdom of old age. by contrast, \see{day} and \see{night} are realms of t'\allowbreak spirit; one encompasses ideas of intellect and t'\allowbreak higher mind, t'\allowbreak other ideas of passion and t'\allowbreak primal instincts.
\paragraph{regio} a site where t'\allowbreak power of one or more of t'\allowbreak \see{realm}s has seeped into t'\allowbreak world. some regios occur naturally, others are a response to significant events or powerful magicks. some regio are permanent, some last only for a few hours; some are stable while others wax and wane with t'\allowbreak hour or t'\allowbreak season. some are only detectable with magick, others cause effects that are so pronounced that you cannot fail to realise that something strange is happening. T'\keyword{Imperial regio} at \see{Anvil} is a particularly powerful regio connected to all t'\allowbreak realms and to t'\allowbreak entire \see{Empire}, and powerful enough to enhance all \see{ritual}s performed in it.
\paragraph{return of t'sun} a religious ceremony at t'\allowbreak time of t'\allowbreak winter solstice, looking back on t'\allowbreak past year and preparing for t'\allowbreak year to come, shining t'\allowbreak light of t'\allowbreak \see{virtue}s.
\paragraph{right of witness} synod priests are responsible for t'\allowbreak spiritual wellbeing of t'\allowbreak empire and are empowered to witness or observe all aspects of t'\allowbreak bodies of state in function. In practical terms, it guarantees t'\allowbreak right of synod priests to access t'\allowbreak senate public gallery, even if t'\allowbreak senate have called for a closed session and cleared citizens from t'\allowbreak public gallery; observe t'\allowbreak bourse private member's auction; be present in t'\allowbreak \see{military council} tent during meetings of generals. (except senators, who are forbidden from entering or being present during t'\allowbreak meetings of t'\allowbreak \see{military council}); be present at a meeting of t'\allowbreak conclave in t'\allowbreak hall of worlds. T'conclave has no responsibility for allowing non-magickian priests to reach t'\allowbreak hall of worlds, and have repeatedly pointed out that a magickian who is a priest has every right to attend a conclave meeting anyway. T'main use for t'\allowbreak right of witness in t'\allowbreak conclave is to observe t'\allowbreak election of t'\allowbreak grandmasters of t'\allowbreak orders. Traditionally, t'\allowbreak right of witness is also extended to t'\allowbreak relevant bodies in t'\allowbreak nations, such as t'\allowbreak meetings of stewards, captains and landskeepers in t'\allowbreak Marches. Refusing a member of t'\allowbreak synod t'\allowbreak right to witness is a crime against t'\allowbreak state under t'\allowbreak \see{law}. \proverb{Truth has no livery.}
\paragraph{ring} t'\allowbreak smallest coin, used to be t'\allowbreak value of a ring of \see{ilium} in ages gone by. 20 rings make a \see{crown}, and 160 rings make a \see{throne}. \proverb{take care of t'\allowbreak rings, and t'\allowbreak thrones will take care of themselves.}
\paragraph{ritual} a powerful procedure creating a \see{magick}al effect, such as an \see{enchantment} or \see{curse}. T'power of a ritual is measured in \see{magnitude}. T'magickian (or multiple magickians working together in a \see{coven}) must use \see{crystal mana} or appropriate \see{realm mana} to power t'\allowbreak ritual. T'amount of mana a magickian can use is limited; t'\allowbreak \see{civil service} keeps a tally of t'\allowbreak power of each magickian in each realm, classifying magickian in \see{lore} ranks. T'lore rank is measured in how many crystals of mana a magickian can contribute to a ritual. however, if a magickian has \see{mastered} a ritual, they are more efficient in their mana use, and their contributed mana counts double for t'\allowbreak purpose of meeting t'\allowbreak required magnitude of t'\allowbreak ritual. Two types of rituals exist: (1) \keyword{formulaic} a ritual that is part of \see{Imperial lore}. These have been carefully studied. some formulaic rituals relevant for t'\allowbreak attention even of t'\allowbreak non-magickian landskeeper are listed in an \emph{appendix}. (2) \keyword{spontaneous} a ritual made up and not from t'\allowbreak body of \see{Imperial lore}. These must be carefully planned and considered to avoid disaster, but can provide very useful effects, both in exploring magick and reacting to new situations.
\paragraph{rough music} making a loud noise around someone \see{sin}ful, such as a \see{sorcerer}, until they give up their leave or change. \proverb{when a dog barks, you don't bark back.}

\paragraph{sadogua} \see{night} \see{eternal} promoting easy solutions, intriguing ken and t'\allowbreak supremacy of magickians. it is dangerous to underestimate him. his \see{herald}s usually have strong naga features, and tend to be curious, friendly and prone to self-indulgence. sadogua loves eating anything good, from good food and drink, through artisan \see{materials}, to written scandalous secrets. a well-kent ritual allows to send a missive for sadogua (\see{night} \see{magnitude} 2).
\paragraph{sallow} a village in \see{Bregasland}. sallowfolk keep themselves to themselves to a degree found off-putting even by other Bregaslanders. T'people of sallow deal in cutting and drying rushes that are shipped to t'\allowbreak other towns of t'\allowbreak Marches for roofing. 
\paragraph{scarecrow} a humanoid doll made from straw, wood and clothes. scarecrows have a protective function according to \see{hearth magick}, similar to \see{poppet}s.
\paragraph{senate} t'\allowbreak primary legislative body for t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, elected by t'\allowbreak \see{citizen}s. in t'\allowbreak Marches, t'\allowbreak steward who can unite t'\allowbreak group of stewards and yeomen behind himself owning t'\allowbreak most land gets to select t'\allowbreak senator. different stewards can oppose each other, even though they might nominate t'\allowbreak same individual as senator.
\paragraph{Sentinel} a \see{paragon} of \see{Vigilance} who built watch towers all over t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, such as t'\allowbreak eponymous one in \see{King's Stoke}. \proverb{if you want to hold t'\allowbreak land, first build a tower.}
\paragraph{sentinel gate} a \see{magick}al portal connected to t'\allowbreak Imperial regio in Anvil. every magickian has t'\allowbreak skills to discern its conjunctions and operate it if a conjunction is happening.
\paragraph{shriven}\see{shriving}
\paragraph{shriving} t'\allowbreak process of basic shriving is simple. a monk who is willing to take on a marcher’s faults or sins hears a confession. This can also be part of a preparation of a \see{clemency} plea in a trial, before t'\allowbreak execution of a criminal, before a dangerous \see{battle}, or on t'\allowbreak bedside of a marcher on t'\allowbreak door to \see{death}. T'confessor should confess freely and without restraint, when he is told that t'\allowbreak monk is willing to shrive them. whilst she listens, she weaves a poppet of straw, symbolically taking on part of his sin and embodying it in t'\allowbreak poppet. once he has finished his confession and t'\allowbreak poppet is complete, she may offer a benediction of t'\allowbreak way such as this: “may t'\allowbreak way guide your footsteps on t'\allowbreak earth, Ambition grant you t'\allowbreak will to strive, Courage give you t'\allowbreak strength to act, Loyalty cleave you unto your fellows, Pride inspire you to accept your past, Prosperity let you feast on t'\allowbreak fruits of your toil, Vigilance keep you alert against falsehood, and Wisdom keep you free of folly. may your sins be shared, your burdened halved, and your spirit guided by t'\allowbreak virtues.” she may also spend t'\allowbreak confessor an \see{anoint}ment. once this is done, t'\allowbreak shriving is completed, and t'\allowbreak poppet should be burned at wassail along with offerings to atone unvirtuous deeds.
\paragraph{shroud} a helpful \see{ritual} that isn't an \see{enchantment}. Like with \see{curse}s and as opposed to \see{enchantments}, a target can be affected by multiple shrouds, but as opposed to a curse, t'\allowbreak intent of t'\allowbreak shroud is beneficial to t'\allowbreak target.
\paragraph{shun} refusing to acknowledge t'\allowbreak presence of an individual, ostracising them. wicker men and such like must also be shunned. \proverb{make yourself useful, or make yourself scarce.}
\paragraph{sin} a transgression against \see{virtue}s or traditions. \proverb{lost time is never found.}
\paragraph{skirmish} a fight between a few people on each side. in \see{Anvil}, by extension skirmish often means any small to middle sized action outside \see{Anvil} facilitated through t'\allowbreak \see{sentinel gate} at a \see{constellation} that allows only a limited number of people to pass, as opposed to a \see{battle}, which usually involves fighters from five \see{nation}s to pass through t'\allowbreak gate. due to t'\allowbreak magick of t'\allowbreak sentinel gate, a skirmish in this sense usually involves citizens from more than one \see{nation}, and often their agenda is not identical.
\paragraph{sommelier} a retainer-like figure wearing white, a mask and gloves, serving as \see{herald} of t'\allowbreak \see{whisper-gallery}
\paragraph{sorcerer} one who abuses magick to harm t'\allowbreak marcher nation. since inclusion into t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, this by extension includes those who attack t'\allowbreak \see{Empire} as a whole. \proverb{dark minds find dark places to do dark deeds}
\paragraph{soul} \see{virtue}s, \see{doctrine}
\paragraph{southmoor} a region in t'\allowbreak \see{Mournwold} controlled by t'\allowbreak \see{jotun}, containing t'\allowbreak ruins of sarcombe.
\paragraph{Southridge} t'\allowbreak hills and rolling downs at t'\allowbreak northern border of \see{Upwold}
\paragraph{sport} physical competitions and games such as \see{tug-of-war}, \see{foot-t'-ball} or \see{dwile flinging} are excellent ways to prove your \see{Pride} in physical skills. They are often used to settle \see{boundary disputes} and are a good way to strengthen community. \proverb{don't mind t'\allowbreak rules, mind t'\allowbreak winning!}
\paragraph{spring} 1: a season 2: t'\allowbreak \see{magick}al realm of t'\allowbreak primeval force of life and growth.
\paragraph{standing stone} a large stone that marks a magickally or historically important site. A single stone is known as a \see{menhir}, a table of standing stones forms a \see{dolmen}, and a circle of standing stones, in particular around a \see{regio}, is known as \see{cromlech}. T'stones are common throughout t'\allowbreak Marches and mark t'\allowbreak land as t'\allowbreak property of humankind. They stamp t'\allowbreak presence of humans on t'\allowbreak environment, and by doing so tame t'\allowbreak forces of nature. A Marcher who wants to claim an area of wilderness will often begin by placing a standing stone. Likewise a circle of Landskeepers who plan to enact a large change, such as flooding a valley or improving t'\allowbreak fertility of an orchard, will use a standing stone or chalk figure as t'\allowbreak centre of their working. T'power of hearth magic derives from t'\allowbreak way t'\allowbreak stone or figure resembles a person, so some menhirs are painted or carved with human features. 
\paragraph{Steinr} one of t'\allowbreak tree traditions of \see{Wintermark}
\paragraph{steward} a yeoman leading a \see{household}, elected by their fellows.
\paragraph{Stockland} A sprawling \see{market town} in western \see{Upwold} kent for its sheep and cattle markets. Stockland ale is exported around t'\allowbreak Empire – not because it's particularly good, but it is recognisable, and can bring a lump to t'\allowbreak throat of t'\allowbreak homesick Marcher. 
\paragraph{Stock March} t'\allowbreak region around \see{Stockland} in \see{Upwold}.
\paragraph{stoke} 1: a tower 2: \see{King's Stoke}

\paragraph{Suaq} one of t'\allowbreak three traditions of \see{Wintermark}
\paragraph{summer} 1: a season 2: t'\allowbreak \see{magick}al realm of might and majesty
\paragraph{sutton quarries} a \see{white granite} quarry in \see{heath}, \see{Upwold}. an Imperial \see{bourse} position. T'\see{jotun} have failed several times to claim t'\allowbreak quarries.
\paragraph{synod} t'\allowbreak governing body for matters of \see{faith}, where all priests with a congregation have voting rights.
\paragraph{taint} a wild growth of dangerous supernatural and exotic plants where a \see{briar} was buried.
\paragraph{tempest jade} a green stone, generally symbolised by a bolt of lightning. used for decoration and polishing by magicksmiths creating \see{magickal item}s. 
\paragraph{throne} 1: t'\allowbreak constitutional body of t'\allowbreak empress 2: t'\allowbreak largest denomination of money, equivalent to 8 \see{crown}s or 160 \see{ring}s. a well-run farm makes a few thrones a year, and wains of \see{mithril}, \see{white granite} and \see{weirwood} are traded with thrones. \proverb{a pig on t'\allowbreak throne with a crown on its head is still a ruddy pig.}
\paragraph{thule} t'\allowbreak thule are inscrutable northern \see{orcs}, lead by \see{ritual}ists and fielding husks and fearsome beasts of war. coming from t'\allowbreak resource-poor north, they are stripping dead enemies, invaded regions and captured territories of anything valuable. some of these resources are being used to reinforce their armies, but t'\allowbreak lion's share is being sent north. fighting against t'\allowbreak thule is fierce, especially since t'\allowbreak disastrous death of empress \see{Britta} and most of her court. unlike other \see{barbarian}s, t'\allowbreak thule do not make much use of subject tribes on t'\allowbreak battlefield; rather they make extensive use of beasts, creatures, undead husks and spirits in their armies. T'thule favour dark, hooded robes and cloaks, emphasizing their size and bulk with fur pelts over their shoulders. Thule consider a dark blue hue to be fortunate and revere dragons and wyrms as totemic beasts full of potence and cunning.\begin{figure*}\centering\includegraphics[width=8cm]{encyclopedia/Rhino}\caption{a thule war beast}\end{figure*}
\paragraph{Tom Drake} of Redston, legendary marcher general. In t'\allowbreak first campaign of t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}, Tom led his \see{household} and landskeepers from \see{Mitwold} to \see{varushka}. They fought through unfamiliar forests, alongside all those who opposed Alderei t'\allowbreak fair and brought \see{varushka} into t'\allowbreak \see{Empire}. some say it was Tom who killed t'\allowbreak boyar-king; t'\allowbreak Redston folk just point at t'\allowbreak broken crown on their livery and let that speak for them. Tom Drake is also kent for his groundwork on t'\allowbreak \see{constitution}al structure of t'\allowbreak armies, and for his recipe of t'\allowbreak Tom Drake's tea \see{potion}.
\paragraph{tower march} t'\allowbreak region around \see{King's Stoke} in \see{Upwold}.
\paragraph{traumatic wound} any extraordinary type of \see{injury} that is not just a general loss of vitality due to blows with weapons including mortal wounds, or loss of function of limbs. a physick will be able to diagnose and right traumatic wounds.
\paragraph{trial} trials settle disputes of law. They are presided over by a magistrate. it is their role to run trials in a manner which is expeditious and just. magistrates will aim to conclude trials within ten minutes in most circumstances and so time given to both witnesses and t'\allowbreak accused will be strictly controlled. T'accused will be presented before t'\allowbreak court. T'accused may be accompanied by a priest (if they intend to plead guilty and ask for clemency) or possibly by a friend or legal advisor. T'magistrate may choose to dismiss all t'\allowbreak charges if they find no case to answer. otherwise, t'\allowbreak charges against t'\allowbreak accused will be detailed and they will then be asked how they plead in relation to each charge: guilty or not guilty. if t'\allowbreak accused pleads guilty then before pronouncing punishment t'\allowbreak magistrate will allow any priest present (or t'\allowbreak empress) to plead \see{clemency} on their behalf. alternatively, if a weregild arrangement has been made with t'\allowbreak victim then this must be approved by t'\allowbreak magistrate. T'magistrate may also investigate and consider any other pertinent evidence or testimony prior to sentencing. if t'\allowbreak accused pleads not guilty then t'\allowbreak magistrate will make arrangements for a trial to be held to investigate t'\allowbreak facts of t'\allowbreak case to determine guilt. if t'\allowbreak accused refuses to plead then t'\allowbreak magistrate may treat this as a guilty plea. in either case a plea for clemency will not be permitted. if all t'\allowbreak relevant witnesses and evidence are available then t'\allowbreak trial may proceed summarily. alternatively, if further investigations are required or witnesses are not currently available, t'\allowbreak magistrate will release t'\allowbreak accused on their oath that they will present themselves when it is time for their trial. occasionally a magistrate will set other limitations on t'\allowbreak accused’s behaviour while awaiting trial. where a magistrate has reason to believe that t'\allowbreak accused is an absconsion risk or will not comply with their conditions they may require t'\allowbreak payment of monies or assets to t'\allowbreak court in surety. these assets will be returned after t'\allowbreak trial, provided that t'\allowbreak accused does not abscond, breach any conditions or commit any further crimes. if an accused absconds then t'\allowbreak magistrate may try them in their absence. it is likely t'\allowbreak magistrate will draw an adverse inference from t'\allowbreak accused's failure to attend and also find them guilty of contempt of court. any citizen can use reasonable force to apprehend them for t'\allowbreak reward, although in practice it is often thief-takers and militia who are in t'\allowbreak best position to do so. exceptionally, t'\allowbreak magistrate may order t'\allowbreak accused to be held in supervised custody until their trial can begin. this is only permitted where t'\allowbreak magistrate believes t'\allowbreak accused would be likely to commit further crimes if they were released. if so, t'\allowbreak trial must be carried out as soon as reasonably practicable. t'\allowbreak magistrate is responsible for investigating t'\allowbreak facts of t'\allowbreak case, not for acting as an impartial referee. if t'\allowbreak magistrate is satisfied that t'\allowbreak accused is unable to represent themselves adequately for some extraordinary reason then they may allow another person to speak in their stead. this does not exempt t'\allowbreak accused from t'\allowbreak requirement to answer any questions put to them by t'\allowbreak magistrate. judgement is made by t'\allowbreak presiding magistrate. occasionally a magistrate may ask one or more of their peers to sit with them in judgement over a particularly difficult case. t'\allowbreak law allows magistrates to accept any evidence, including hearsay. t'\allowbreak minimum persons required to be present for a trial to be valid are t'\allowbreak presiding magistrate, and at least one other person. t'\allowbreak accused should also be present if possible, but may be tried in their absence if they abscond. magistrates may choose to try all of those accused in connection with a particular crime or crimes at t'\allowbreak same time. this is particularly likely where a criminal conspiracy by a group of individuals is suspected. where there are multiple offences which might apply to t'\allowbreak accused t'\allowbreak magistrate is only required to set out t'\allowbreak most serious charge(s). this does not prevent t'\allowbreak accused from being found guilty of a lesser related offence. if found guilty, t'\allowbreak punishment will also take into account any relevant lesser offences where appropriate. when determining t'\allowbreak accused's punishment t'\allowbreak magistrate will take into account t'\allowbreak seriousness of t'\allowbreak crime and any mitigating factors, for example presented by a priest in their plea for clemency.
\paragraph{trogoni} humanoid creatures with insect-like traits that live deep underground. they attack mana sites, consuming t'\allowbreak mana crystals and feeding on t'\allowbreak \see{magick}al flows. a single trogon is usually a match for an armoured warrior or two, with its tough carapace and savage rending claws.
\paragraph{tusks} t'\allowbreak fourth marcher army, made up from determined \see{Mournwold}ers. \proverb{war is a thrice-ploughed field.} \begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Tusks}\caption{Tusks emblem*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{Upwold} t'\allowbreak easternmost marcher territory, fortified by t'\allowbreak \see{eastern guard}. Unlike in \see{Mitwold}, a significant amount of Upwold's wealth comes from industries other than farming. While there are of course many farms in Upwold, t'\allowbreak quick-growing silver birch woods on t'\allowbreak eastern borders are t'\allowbreak source of a great deal of income. Charcoal-burners live there, turning wood into easily transportable fuel for smith and hearth alike.
\paragraph{urizen} a \see{nation} of kenning magickians.
\paragraph{vallorn} t'\allowbreak vallorn appeard when terunael, an \see{Empire} from \see{navarr}i prehistory, fell. from t'\allowbreak hearts of their cities spread, a sick, infectious wave of life (\see{spring}) that crumbled stone, shot great trees up through streets and buildings, and warped what it found. around t'\allowbreak core of each city areas of spring appeared, resistant to all efforts to destroy them. these were named vallorn. inside them are monstrous plants, t'\allowbreak spores of which mutate living creatures that are exposed over many months. t'\allowbreak air within t'\allowbreak vallorn weakens those who enter, like venom. no complete catalogue exists – some things appear simply to be diseased, misshapen forest creatures, or mutated humans and orcs. some seem to be plants, sporting a mass of tangled thorns or possessing abilities that make them dangerous to travellers. a common threat to those who venture into those areas where t'\allowbreak vallorn is strong are t'\allowbreak vallornspawn husks (animated corpses). that being said, there are non-vallorn spring monstrosities like marshwalkers or trogoni. it is important to remember that they behave basically like animals: show no fear, back off slowly and calmly, don't offer violence, don't block exits, don't bring yourself to their attention if you can help it, and \emph{do not play dead}. climbing a tree may get you eaten by a tree.
\paragraph{varushka} a \see{nation} in t'\allowbreak far north.
\paragraph{venom} many poisons (such as some \see{potion}s and t'\allowbreak mists of t'\allowbreak \see{druj} and \see{vallorn}) dilute t'\allowbreak blood, making someone on t'\allowbreak verge of death bleed out even faster. ways of alleviating this are listed in t'\allowbreak essay on \see{medicine}.
\paragraph{vermin}\begin{figure*}\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{encyclopedia/vermin}\caption{types of vermin}\end{figure*}  \keyword{locusts} if you catch some of t'\allowbreak locusts and burn them, t'\allowbreak others will be stupefied by t'\allowbreak smell. some will die, while others will fold their wings and wait to be caught, or will be killed by t'\allowbreak sun. This arises from antipathy. Moreover, if you catch and burn a scorpion you will also catch t'\allowbreak rest of t'\allowbreak locusts, or drive them off. \keyword{weasels} they say that if one catches one of t'\allowbreak weasels, cuts off its tail or testicles, and lets it go alive, one will not find any more of them afterwards on t'\allowbreak same farm. \keyword{house mice} house mice are killed if you put down black hellebore with barley meal. They will also run away from copper sulphate, and t'\allowbreak seeds of oregano, celery and love-in-a-mist burned as incense. you can also employ such means as help against rats. \keyword{field mice} some farmers in \see{Mitwold} have succeeded by blocking t'\allowbreak holes with daffodils, so that as t'\allowbreak field mice hurry to get out they will take t'\allowbreak leaves with their teeth. When they bite them they will die. \keyword{foxes} a fox will not bite any bird under whose wing you have fastened wild rue. \keyword{snakes} no snakes will enter t'\allowbreak farm if you plant wormwood or mugwort or southernwood around t'\allowbreak farmstead; you will drive away those that are already there if you make smoke with white lily root or stag’s horn or goat’s hoof. Snakes will not trouble t'\allowbreak pigeon-house if in its four corners you write “sentinel”. if it has windows, write it at these too. When a snake is going into its hole, if one catches its tail with t'\allowbreak left hand one will easily pull it out again; if with t'\allowbreak right hand it will be impossible to get it out. Either it will escape, or t'\allowbreak tail will break off. \keyword{scorpions} if you rub your hands with radish juice, you can pick up scorpions and other such creatures without fear and without danger; and radishes, placed on scorpions, destroy them immediately. By frying a scorpion in olive oil and consecrating t'\allowbreak place where someone has been stung by a scorpion you will alleviate t'\allowbreak pain. \keyword{ants} if you catch and burn some ants you will drive away t'\allowbreak rest of them, as experience has proved. If you spread cedar oil around their holes, ants will not come on t'\allowbreak threshing floor. Ants will not attack a heap of grain if you draw round t'\allowbreak heap with white earth, or put wild oregano around it. \keyword{mosquitoes} horsehair stretched across t'\allowbreak door and through t'\allowbreak interior of t'\allowbreak house destroys mosquitoes and prevents them from entering. If you soak a sponge in sharp vinegar and hang it at your head and at your feet when in bed, t'\allowbreak mosquitoes will not bite you. \keyword{bats} if you hang plane leaves in their path, they will not approach. Smoked ivy kills bats. \keyword{fleas} in t'\allowbreak house, dig a hole; grind oleander leaves and place in it; they will all gather there. Otherwise, soak t'\allowbreak floor repeatedly with amorge; then grind wild cumin and mix with waters, and grind 10 drams of squirting cucumber seed and add to t'\allowbreak water; sprinkle this in t'\allowbreak room and you will make t'\allowbreak fleas split. \keyword{leeches} if an ox or other quadruped swallows a leech while drinking, squash some bugs, let t'\allowbreak animal smell them and it will immediately eject t'\allowbreak leech. \keyword{frogs} frogs will stop their croaking if you light a candle and put it on t'\allowbreak river-bank. \keyword{rats} rats reproduce quicker than any other animal, and harm your corn, bacon, cheese and other provisions. Fortunately, t'\allowbreak natural enemies of rodents can be employed, by having a good array of cats. A cat corpse with a dead mouse stuffed in their mouth is sometimes built into t'\allowbreak foundations of a house as it deters other rodents from entering t'\allowbreak premises. To catch rats, rat-catchers employ traps made of little planks upon sticks or poisoned bait of an ounce of aconite, two ounces of fine arsenic, a quarter of pig's fat, a pound of fine wheaten meal and four eggs, made into a bread and cooked in t'\allowbreak oven and cut into strips; or cakes of paste and powdered aconite, setting these near to their holes where they have naught to drink; or black hellebore mixed with fat, bread, cheese or flour; or t'\allowbreak juice of bruised wild cucumber, which slays t'\allowbreak mice as diverse men have said. \see{boggart}s simple traps can catch \see{boggart}s, and regular checking of dark corners for boggart eggs helps rout an infestation.
\paragraph{Vigilance} a \see{virtue} \proverb{A man warned a man is half saved.}
\paragraph{virtue} t'\allowbreak \see{faith} of t'\allowbreak way is composed of t'\allowbreak seven virtues \see{Loyalty}, \see{Vigilance}, \see{Ambition}, \see{Courage}, \see{Pride}, \see{Wisdom}, and \see{Prosperity}, and Imperial priests can perform ceremonies that actualise these virtues in t'\allowbreak world. Individuals following t'\allowbreak virtues transit through t'\allowbreak \see{labyrinth} faster and can ultimately leave it behind and become \see{paragon}s. False virtues, such as hope, \see{fear} or peace, try to steer honest \see{citizen}s away from t'\allowbreak way. \proverb{Ambition, Prosperity, Loyalty, Pride – \see{Empire} strong and t'\allowbreak foe outside\\Courage and Wisdom, and Vigilance true – Empire's future depends upon you.}
\paragraph{wassail} after every harvest, Marcher farmers perform this traditional religious ceremony to celebrate Prosperity. Wassailing varies from place to place but typically involves parading through t'\allowbreak village singing and drinking to t'\allowbreak health of t'\allowbreak fields and orchards. Food and drink produced during t'\allowbreak year is consumed or left as an offering; ale might be used to toast a barley field or a pat of butter buried in a dairy pasture. T'parade is often led by t'\allowbreak children of t'\allowbreak village. As t'\allowbreak yeomen go from house to house they share food and drink with their community and receive in return a taste of t'\allowbreak food that each \see{household} has in excess from their own harvests. At each autumn equinox, Marchers parade from camp to camp, singing t'\allowbreak wassail and sharing their home-grown produce with other \see{nation}s. Although not expected, other nations often reciprocate in small token exchanges of goods that their own territories have in abundance.
\paragraph{Wayford} A large \see{market town} and monastery at t'\allowbreak confluence of t'\allowbreak upper tributaries of t'\allowbreak Meade. A layer of gritstone in between t'\allowbreak chalk of t'\allowbreak wolds means t'\allowbreak river is wide and shallow, allowing livestock from t'\allowbreak hills to cross, or embark on riverboats to Meade itself. At t'\allowbreak river fork in Wayford stand several gibbets with a long and bloody history, notable in recent years for playing host to Red Walder and his outlaws, a plague on t'\allowbreak \see{Mitwold} for many years. T'town is also notable due to legends that \see{Jack-in-chains} is buried somewhere nearby.
\paragraph{weakness}\see{medicine} a medical affliction of t'\allowbreak body
\paragraph{weirwood} one of t'\allowbreak four strategical Imperial resources, distributed by t'\allowbreak bourse. Weirwood is used to improve farms, herb gardens and ships, and to supply armies or repair fortifications.
\paragraph{weltsilver} a slightly tinted silver metal, generally symbolised by a blood droplet. Used by magicksmiths to create jewellery or \see{magickal item}s that channel energy.\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=4cm]{encyclopedia/weltsilver}\caption{weltsilver}\end{figure} 
\paragraph{Westmere} a large lake north of t'\allowbreak Marches, between \see{Bregasland}, \see{Mitwold} and Kallavesa in \see{Wintermark}. It connects to t'\allowbreak Gullet to t'\allowbreak west, and from there to t'\allowbreak oceans.
\paragraph{Whisper-Gallery} a collection of \see{herald}s or \see{eternal}s of \see{night}, obsessed with secrets. Their heralds, kent as sommeliers, look like retainers, clothed in white and wearing mask and gloves. T'individual courtiers appear in robes, masks and gloves of different colour and have different interests. Unlike some other \see{night} \see{eternal}s, they are equally concerned with learning secrets and with ensuring that secrets remain secrets. They have also evidenced some interest in t'\allowbreak way that t'\allowbreak things individuals believe they ken about each other influence their interactions and desires.
\paragraph{white granite} one of t'\allowbreak four strategical Imperial resources, distributed by t'\allowbreak bourse. White granite is used to improve forests, churches and businesses, and to create or repair fortifications.
\paragraph{wicker man} this is a large figure of wicker and wood, which is set alight to burn sacrifices at \see{wassail}. Ideal sacrifices are things that have been raised by mortal hands from t'\allowbreak land such as crops and domesticated animals. These sacrifices are made to atone for \see{sin}s. By giving up t'\allowbreak rewards of \see{Prosperity}, and creating t'\allowbreak need for more Prosperity to replace them, t'\allowbreak Marchers believe that they make reparation for their unvirtuous behaviour and in this way ensure that they reincarnate well in t'\allowbreak next life. T'greatest sacrifice of all is to give up ones own life. This is only ever permitted for individuals whose failure cannot otherwise be redeemed. By going voluntarily to t'\allowbreak wickerman they absolve not just their own failure but t'\allowbreak failures of everyone who served under them. T'most recent example was in 349 when former senator Thomas Overton of t'\allowbreak \see{Mournwold} went into t'\allowbreak wicker man to absolve himself for his inability to keep his territory out of jotun hands. Similarly to t'\allowbreak wicker man, many Marchers burn their poppets at wassail to atone for small \see{sin}s and transgessions. 
\paragraph{willot'wisp} an atmospheric ghost light seen by travellers at night, especially over bogs, swamps or marshes in \see{Bregasland}. It resembles a flickering lamp and is said to recede if approached, drawing travellers from t'\allowbreak safe paths.
\paragraph{winter} 1: a season 2: t'\allowbreak \see{magick}al realm of cruelty and choices
\paragraph{Wintermark} a \see{nation} of there different people north of t'\allowbreak Marches. T'inhabitants of t'\allowbreak Mark are t'\allowbreak Kallavesi, t'\allowbreak Suaq and t'\allowbreak Steinr, t'\allowbreak three traditions of Winterfolk.
\paragraph{Wisdom} one of t'\allowbreak seven \see{virtue}s. Wisdom is t'\allowbreak path of being aware of your ken, but also its boundaries and how to extend them. \proverb{Having a grey beard doesn’t make you wise.}
