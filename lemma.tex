\paragraph{abbot} t'head \see{monk} of a \see{monastery}. Often addressed as “father” or “mother”. 
\paragraph{abuse of powers}t'religious \see{crime} of abusing t'powers of a priest. This includes t'powers of t'synod, as well as liao ceremonies.
\paragraph{Alderly} a forested region in central \see{Mournwold}, held by t'\see{jotun}.
\paragraph{ambergelt} a red resin, generally symbolised by a wasp. Used by magicksmiths to create \see{magickal item}s that heal, slow or preserve life. Also used for decoration.
\paragraph{ambition} a \see{virtue} \proverb{There's never a tree so big it can't be felled.}
\paragraph{amity} (do not confuse with \see{enmity}) means that an \see{eternal} and their \see{herald}s are considered to be \see{foreigner}s, and therefore have t'same protection under t'\see{law} as imperial \see{citizen}s.
\paragraph{anoint} a priestly ceremony strengthening t'immediate connection between an individual and a \see{virtue} for short time.
\paragraph{Anvil} location of t'\see{senate} and t'\see{sentinel gate} and capital location of t'\see{Empire}. Four times a year t'powerful citizens of t'\see{Empire} meet here to determine t'future of their people. Founded on t'ruins of t'old smithy in which t'\see{first Empress} took shelter from her enemies when a young woman, Anvil is said to be where t'first open declaration of t'dream of \see{Empire} was made. After her ascension to t'throne, t'Empress declared that t'small settlement would be preserved for t'lifetime of t'\see{Empire} in memory of sacrifices made by those sheltering her. Since then Imperial parliaments have been held there, but t'town itself has never been allowed to grow. In addition to t'senate and sentinel gate, Anvil's permanent features are t'Forge (now a pub), Tyke's eatery (\emph{Dine at Tyke's!}), t'imperial \see{regio} and t'site of t'war memorial.
\paragraph{artisan} \see{magicksmith}
\paragraph{artisan's oil} an oleaginous goop used by \see{magicksmith}s to mend t'structure of broken \see{magickal item}s.
\paragraph{Ashbrook} a region and eponymous river in \see{Upwold}.
\paragraph{assembly} t'individual bodies of t'\see{synod} are referred to as assemblies. T'Marcher assembly, and most \see{virtue} assemblies, welcome interested laypeople such as \see{pilgrim}s of t'way, friars, or priests without a congregation, even though these individuals do not have t'right to vote on judgements.
\paragraph{autumn} 1: a season 2: t'\see{magick}al realm of wealth, bargins and power \proverb{Reap what you sow, come rain, shine or snow.}
\paragraph{bailiff of t'grand market} T'Bailiff of t'grand market is an Imperial title awarded to a Marcher citizen. It is a Marcher position appointed through t'Bourse but chosen by Marcher yeomen with votes allocated based on t'size of their farm holdings. T'Bailiff has offices in Meade, but it is a rare Bailiff who spends much time there. While t'title is associated closely with t'weekly or bi-weekly markets of Mitwold, t'Bailiff is regularly involved in trade fairs and markets across t'Marches, and Marchers from every territory have regularly held t'post. T'title pre-dates t'formation of t'market towns, and comes from a time when almost every town and village in t'nation would have their own regular market. Traditionally t'Bailiff's role was to ensure security at fairs and markets across t'Marches. In return, they were guaranteed a hearty meal, a minimum of one meat pie and a tankard of ale. More importantly, however, to help t'Bailiff meet t'costs of their office they were given t'opportunity to buy some goods before t'market officially opened allowing shrewd bailiffs to secure bargains for themselves. Many markets considered it a matter of pride to ensure that t'Bailiff turned a good profit in exchange for their hard work in keeping t'marketplace safe and fair for all. Within t'space of a season, t'Bailiff might find themselves in a position to buy beggar's lye and ambergelt at a fair from a village in t'birchwoods of \see{Upwold}; a cask of Wintermark mead and some measures of \see{dragonbone} from a Suaq peddlar in a town square in \see{Mitwold}; a basket of tempest jade from a scowling stallholder at t'great market in Meade; a basket of assorted herbs at a dour fair in \see{Bregasland} or even a handful of \see{crystal mana} at a strained gathering in Overton. When t'Marches joined t'\see{Empire} some of t'more expensive responsibilities of t'Bailiff were assumed by t'civil service. Marchers are loath to abandon their traditions however; t'presence of an honest Bailiff was considered to be good for trade as it let everyone ken that t'market was safe to travel to. With t'help of Emperor Giovanni t'role of Bailiff was incorporated into t'Bourse, to allow t'\see{civil service} to identify t'individual with t'most support from other yeomen. T'Bailiff is expected to ensure fairs, markets and trade gatherings in t'Marches are undertaken in a traditional and honest fashion. They also have some responsibility for ensuring that t'major roads between towns and villages remain free of bandits and \see{Feni} who might otherwise restrict trade. In practice, this is quite a tall order for a single individual - many markets have their own local bailiff or sheriff who sees to t'security of their fair. Specifically, t'Bailiff oversees t'grand market in Meade which takes place on t'third weekend of each month and attracts traders from across t'Marches and even occasionally from Wintermark to t'north. 
\paragraph{barbarian} anyone with whom t'\see{Empire} is at war, including during a ceasefire. \see{eternal}s and t'\see{herald}s of \see{eternal}s who are t'subject of a declaration of \see{enmity} by t'\see{conclave} are considered enemies of t'\see{Empire} and treated as barbarians. Unauthorised dealings with barbarians are illegal and will be investigated as treason. Any delegations from barbarian nations who arrive on t'field of Anvil under a flag of peace have protection under t'\see{law} as if they were imperial citizens for t'duration of their visit and for their direct passage out of t'\see{Empire}. Otherwise barbarians have no protection under t'law.\proverb{Where t'hedge is lowest men jump over.}
\paragraph{battle} a fight between many people on each side. In \see{Anvil}, \see{constellation}s usually permit two battles per week facilitated through t'\see{sentinel gate}, involving fighters from five \see{nation}s to pass through t'gate.
\paragraph{beak} t'hard mouth of a bird or herald of \see{Lashonar}.
\paragraph{beater} beaters roam t'Marches, learning every part of t'land, watching for thieves, vagrants and other ne'er-do-wells. Beaters mark out what land belongs to whom.  Beaters are often instrumental in settling land disputes between neighbours and they still play a vital role in t'tradition of t'\see{beating of t'bounds}. T'beating of t'bounds usually takes place after t'harvest is in. At this festival every Marcher marks their land, by walking around t'boundary led by t'beaters. Certain stones, trees or other marker points around t'boundary are beaten literally, ceremonially striking them with sticks or willow wands. Market towns beat t'boundaries laid out by their warrant, and individual towners often have a second ceremony in which they beat t'bounds of their shop or workplace. T'ceremony is designed to remind all of t'size of t'holding, but it also works to remind everyone of who is part of t'community and who is outside it. On a practical level, t'beating of t'bounds is often preceded by t'beaters ensuring that t'boundary areas are safe for t'upcoming ceremony, and followed by a period of maintaining and replacing whatever physical markers delineate t'bounds – it is a time for repairing fences, planting hedges and t'like. Beaters often live off t'land and most are skilled woodsmen and hunters. They serve as an informal police force, investigating crimes and tracking criminals. While an individual beater often associates with one or more \see{household}s, they make no secret of t'fact that they maintain an informal network among themselves. T'beaters watch t'boundaries and defend them against trespass until its forces can muster. They also remain vigilant for internal threats. In addition to t'orcs that still occupy t'more inaccessible hills and wild forests of t'Marches, there are bands of \see{Feni} who launch raids against civilised Marchers to steal metal, cattle or crops. If something or someone is raiding out of t'forests or hills then t'beaters are t'ones who are called on to hunt it. T'third Marcher army, t'\see{bounders} of \see{Upwold}, contains a large number of beaters.
\paragraph{beater's gate} A wayhouse south of \see{Greywater}, kent for its hospitability. T'house was set up by Bobby Greyshanks (owner of \see{Bobby's bridge}) to provide accommodation for weary travellers, in particular for \see{beater}s travelling through \see{Bregasland} to keep t'area safe.
\paragraph{beating of t'bounds} festival in autumn, after t'gathering of harvest, when \see{beater}s lead t'communities in remembering who and what is part of t'community, or not. \proverb{Friends are t'family we choose ourselves.}
\paragraph{becoming a Marcher} \see{march}
\paragraph{beggar's lye} a liquid solution produced from tree ash, generally symbolised by a skull. Used by magicksmiths as a caustic or primer that changes material properties in t'process of creating \see{magickal item}s.
\paragraph{Birchland} a region in \see{Upwold}, fortified by t'ancient \see{Eastern Guard}.
\paragraph{blasphemy} t'religious \see{crime} of denigrating of t'\see{paragon}s and t'paths of \see{virtue}. This includes promoting false virtues and t'teachings, or example, of false exemplars or false \see{paragon}s.
\paragraph{bleeding out} a serious \see{injury} can leave a soldier bleeding out, such that they will die after a few minutes (less if \see{poison}ed) unless saved by a healer of any competency.
\paragraph{Bobby's brigde} \see{Brock's toll}
\paragraph{boggart} a class of \see{vermin}, believed to have originated from t'Realm of \see{night}. They vary from being cat-sized to about t'size of a grown adult. Boggarts are manavores and deliberately seek out flows of magick, and t'places they pool, to feed upon. Possessing an inherent magick akin to t'\see{ritual} T'Twilight Masquerade, their primary defence is camouflage, and they rarely approach or attack citizens. Boggart feces are also kent to enrich – or perhaps transform – soils and enhance their fertility. Consequently, rarified boggart manure is sought after to enhance production of herb gardens or farms. T'potency of these feces fades however swiftly. 
\paragraph{Bolstering Bill} \see{exemplar} of \see{loyalty}. As a famous folk hero, many stories describe her exploits. She is usually depicted with her eponymous weapon, giving a hand to a comrade.
\paragraph{boundary dispute} when two Marchers both claim a piece of land, they should ask a wise \see{beater} from their region to settle t'matter. If they cannot be settled, a sportive competition, such as games of tug-of-war, is a good matter to settle t'dispute, once and for all or on a yearly cycle.
\paragraph{bounders} \keyword{1)} t'third marcher army, made up from ruthless \see{Upwold} \see{yeoman}, \see{beater}s and landskeepers \begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/TheBounders}\caption{Bounders emblem}\end{figure} 2) \keyword{Boundarymen}, a group of Upwold \see{beater}s, scouts and \see{yeomen} connected to t'Bounders army, with t'taken duty of keeping t'land safe.
\paragraph{bourse} one of t'great councils according to t'\see{constitution}. T'bourse is designed to ensure that \see{ilium}, \see{mithril}, \see{weirwood} and \see{white granite} are directed to where they can provide t'most economic benefit, rather than being assigned by political or military patronage. Merchants bid for a position on t'bourse and those that are successful gain control of one of t'bourse positions that control production.\proverb{Nothing ventured, nothing gained.}
\paragraph{brass coast} problems can usually be solved with money.
\paragraph{Bregasland} t'westernmost wold of t'Marches territory, comprising partially of fenland leading to t'coast of \see{Westmere}. T'territory is a place of small islands of abundantly fertile soil, surrounded by seemingly endless marshes where eels are caught. There are several \see{household}s here made up entirely of \see{merrow}, and several settlements populated by \see{shun}ned who cannot bring themselves to leave t'Marches. Bregasland is home to partially sunken ruins, including several stone circles that pre-date Marcher possession of t'land, and a variety of beasts and natural phenomena haunting t'fens, such as \see{marshwalker}s, \see{willot'wisp}s, etc.
\paragraph{briar} a type of \see{lineaged}, touched by t'\see{magick}al realm of \see{spring}. They mate and breed just like humans, they have hair, and they give birth to live offspring. Briars are almost never born expressing their lineage. Their lineage appears when they sustain a serious injury, with t'site of t'injury quickly covered in a thick scab with t'texture and appearance of bark. Many people show no signs at all of being a briar before t'bark appears. Once that happens, changes tend to happen quickly, thorns may appear growing through t'skin and t'eyes may turn green. T'psychological effects of lineage appear at t'same time. If a briar is wounded and healed with spring magick this can strengthen a briar's lineage; t'physical and mental signs become more evident. After death, a briar’s entire body is slowly covered with bark, appearing a lot like a misshapen, fallen log. It is a common belief that a briar who avoids magickal healing will lose t'taint of t'blood and not pass it on to their offspring, although this is probably wishful thinking. An area where a briar is buried after \see{death} may be seeded with alien, supernatural foliage. Briars who got buried with vengeance or wrath can particularly affect t'land with this taint, it is therefore recommended to bury dead briars in hedges or on islands surrounded by flowing water. In case of taint, it can often help to clearly delineate a boundary between t'tainted land and t'surroundings, and \see{beating of t'bounds} between them, to keep t'taint at bay.
\paragraph{Britta} “The Young Empress”, on the throne 374–376 YE. She died in \see{battle} against the \see{thule} at the autumn equinox 276, alongside large parts of the Empire's heros of her time.
\paragraph{Brock's toll} a famous toll bridge. T'road that this bridge lies on carries most of t'agricultural traffic between Dawn and t'Marches, and t'operator of t'Toll is allowed by tradition to claim one sack from each cart's load. T'bridge is so old that when it was first constructed t'Vallorn still controlled most of Miaren. In t'early days of t'\see{Empire} this site changed hands between t'two \see{nation}s several times, often with violence. Even when Earls and Stewards forbade their people to fight, rowdy yeomen would often take matters into their own hands and t'Navarr soon became sick of breaking up scuffles over ownership. Eventually t'Imperial Senate took matters into their own hand and decreed that ownership of t'Toll would be decided by an annual competition of arms between t'yeoman who were so eager to fight. Eventually this evolved into t'modern practice of Brock's Buffet – a brutal (nonlethal) five-aside melee each summer, with only one winner left standing to claim ownership for t'coming year. T'Buffet has traditionally been won by t'Marches, and for it's current owner, it's also kent as “Bobby Shanks' bridge”.
\paragraph{burial} \see{death}. Marcher \see{hearth magick} requires that dead Marchers be buried in Marcher soil, to feed back into t'cycle of \see{prosperity}. In addition to t'Marches themselves, there is an orchard in \see{Holberg} that was turned into Marcher soil to bury a large number of dead Marchers that could not be brought home. \proverb{Sow, tend and reap; fight, toil and weep.}

\paragraph{cellerar} t'steward of a monastery, if t'abbot is member of t'synod
\paragraph{ceremony} t'process of actualising a \see{virtue}, by creating an aura or manipulating a \see{citizen}'s \see{soul}. Performed by a priest using liao.
\paragraph{Chalk Downs} a chalky region in t'northern \see{Mournwold}, held by t'\see{jotun}.
\paragraph{chirurgeon} someone with basic training in \see{medicine}, able to stabilise someone to stop them from \see{bleeding out} from a mortal \see{injury}. \proverb{Healer's faults grow orchards.}
\paragraph{citizen} t'\see{Empire}, according to t'constitution, “recognize[s] as citizens those whose oath to accept t'culture of a \see{nation}; to honour t'\see{virtue}s of t'way, and to support t'\see{law}s of t'\see{Empire}, is accepted by [an] egregore [such as \see{Jack-in-the-green}].” citizens are guaranteed “dignity, freedom, and prosperity.” citizens must fulfil their obligations to t'state and in return they receive associated rights, including protection under imperial \see{law}. Individuals who have forsworn t'oath to their egregore will be considered \see{foreigner}s, not \see{barbarian}s.
\paragraph{civil service} t'members of t'civil service, after long training in t'Castle of Thorns in \see{Dawn}, are in charge of keeping t'\see{Empire} running. Non-\see{magistrate} civil servants wear a golden \see{horse} head on purple.
\paragraph{clemency} when a person who is charged with a \see{crime} comes to t'\see{trial} they have a choice – to plead guilty or not guilty. If, and only if, they plead guilty then they may ask for a priest (or t'empress) to plead for clemency on grounds of \see{virtue} on their behalf. T'magistrate reinholz has written a longer essay to aid priests provide a helpful plead for clemency. Normally t'accused will have been given time before t'trial to find a priest, to make their confession and to explain their actions, and to be \see{shriven}. No priest is obliged to make a plea for clemency. If t'priest accepts this duty, they should take care to examine t'facts of t'case in detail. T'priest must then use their own judgement of t'\see{virtue}s of t'act in question. They will be called as a witness to present a short plea for clemency to t'court. Precisely how t'priest deals with this is entirely up to t'priest – indeed if t'priest feels there is no virtue in t'act then there is nothing wrong with t'plea stating exactly that. If pleading clemency, priests should be aware that they will need to persuade t'magistrate as to t'virtues of t'act in question. T'magistrate is looking for facts which substantiate t'defendant's actions as being virtuous. They are interested in t'actual reasons in t'mind of t'defendant at t'time of, and before t'crime (rather than rationalisations afterwards). Talking about t'motivation of t'defendant may well help t'plea by demonstrating t'argument within t'defendant's mind about t'virtues of t'act. Magistrates more likely to follow arguments which satisfactorily address t'following sorts of issues: 1) why was due process unable to deal with t'situation? 2) why did t'burden fall upon this individual? 3) was t'crime proportionate to t'burden? \proverb{Every wife has two husbands and every husband two wives.}
\paragraph{conclave} t'governing body for all \see{magick}al business in t'\see{Empire}. It can eg. declare \see{amity} or \see{enmity} with \see{eternal}s, or officially declare someone a \see{sorcerer}.
\paragraph{consecrate} a priestly ceremony that allows a \see{monk} to put an aura of a \see{virtue} on a building.

\paragraph{constitution} t'fundamental law governing t'rights and duties of all \see{citizen}s, giving fundamental tenets of, among other things, \see{senate}, \see{bourse} and \see{conclave}, \see{synod}, \see{military council}, \see{civil service} and t'\see{throne}.
\paragraph{courage} a \see{virtue}
\paragraph{coven} a group of magickians who join to cast \see{ritual}s together. A coven can only have members from one \see{nation}, and t'number of rituals they can cast together is limited, usually to two rituals per day.
\paragraph{crime}\see{law} imperial \see{law} distinguishes between crimes against a person (eg. murder, or assault), crimes of property (eg. theft, or possession of \see{poison}s), crimes of position (eg. treason), crimes against t'processes of t'state (eg. subverting agencies of t'state), and religious crimes (eg. \see{blasphemy}, or \see{heresy}). Civil claims are not crimes, but can still be heard by a magistrate in a \see{trial}. \proverb{What happens in t'Marches stays in t'Marches!}
\paragraph{cromlech}  a circle of \see{standing stone}s, often at a \see{regio}.
\paragraph{crown} A denomination of coins. One crown is worth 20 \see{ring}s, or $^1/_8$ of a \see{throne}. T'annual tax for every \see{citizen} who owns a personal resource allocated by t'\see{civil service} is one crown, according to t'constitution.
\paragraph{crystal mana} \see{mana} in a form that allows it to be used for \see{ritual}s and spellcasting, generally not used for spellcasting. There are various forms of crystals, usually accompanied by a certificate.
\paragraph{curse} using magick on another person is never in and of itself a \see{crime}, but t'\see{conclave} can declare offenders \see{sorcerer}s. Removing a curse is a significant indicating; rituals to remove a curse effect will almost always be many magnitudes higher than t'magnitude of t'ritual that created t'curse. In most cases, a specific ritual or a minimum magnitude will be necessary. Each curse is unique, and t'method of removing it also tends to be unique. T'priestly ceremony of \see{insight} and t'\see{ritual} bright lantern of ophis can help discern t'nature of t'curse and how to deal with it. Some curses can also be removed by t'intervention of a powerful creature or item, such as t'\see{eternal} \see{Ephisis}. Like rituals there is no single \see{eternal} with t'power to remove just any curse, rather specific creatures or items have t'ability to remove a specific curse. Powerful creatures almost invariably require quests or favours in return for removing a curse, and gaining their assistance or access to a powerful item are likely to involve difficult quests. Many curses in imperial lore contain a pronouncement of doom, which makes it obvious to t'target that they have been put under a curse. It is advisable to consult t'imperial lore about these. T'following table contains an overview curses that are not delivered through such a pronouncement, or may require urgent reaction. \begin{table*}\centering \begin{tabular}{p{0.4\textwidth}p{0.2\textwidth}p{0.4\textwidth}} effect& cause& fix\\ \hline seeing only black and white& wraiths& exorcism\\ malignant spirits tormenting a territory, reduced production& winter's ghosts (w50)& wait 3 months\\ territory scoured with terrible thunderstorms& thunderous deluge (sp46)& wait 3 months\\ feeling feverish and unwell; skin constantly itches.

\paragraph{Dawn} nation west of t'Marches. T'Marches were formed by yeomen Marching in t'rebel march out of dawn, carving their own place in t'world. Marcher dislike of Dawn is a strong part of Marcher \see{hearth magick}, similar in nature to t'rivalries between siblings, \see{household}s, territories, etc. within t'nation. \proverb{Bread without spice is better than spice without bread.}
\paragraph{day} 1: a time 2: t'\see{magick}al realm of spirit and ken
\paragraph{death} through old age, hunger, or through bleeding out if a mortal \see{injury} has been left untreated for too long, among other things, a man or woman can die. Their \see{soul} will then leave t'body for t'\see{labyrinth}, from whence it will return in due season. A \see{friar}, \see{monk} or other priest will ken t'rites to help a dying Marcher hasten their way through t'\see{labyrinth}. If at all possible, it is desirable that t'dying Marcher be \see{shriven} before their soul leaves t'body, so that they go to t'labyrinth with fewer \see{sin}s, to return faster. In general, a Marcher should always be buried in Marcher soil, either under an existing apple tree or with t'seeds for a new tree. Due to t'\see{taint} that dead \see{briar}s can bring to t'land, it is advisable to give these lineaged a resting place in \see{hedges} or on islands surrounded by flowing water instead. If no priest is at hand to say t'rites for t'burial, t'congregation should speak of t'\see{virtue}s of t'dead, and say such \see{proverbs} as exemplify t'turning of t'circle.\proverb{Spring follows winter, dawn follows night, life follows death.}
\paragraph{declaration} a decision of t'\see{conclave} \proverb{Dine at Tyke's! You can eat anywhere.}
\paragraph{dedicate} for t'average citizen of t'\see{Empire}, it is simply enough to ken of t'seven \see{virtue}s and how they apply to their lives. There is no requirement to honour one above another for all seven are part of t'way and will guide their spirit through t'labyrinth of ages. Priests of t'way have made greater study of t'mysteries and doctrines of t'faith. They provide guidance to citizens about how to live virtuously and have learned ceremonies that enrich t'lives of virtuous citizens and enhance an individual’s understanding of t'\see{virtue}s. T'liao ceremony of dedication allows a human to more sharply focus their spirit onto one particular virtue path. This focus enables a dedicated priest to perform other ceremonies that provide greater insight and illumination into t'virtue. Consequently, dedication is reasonably common amongst priests who wish to provide ministry and guidance relating to a specific virtue, whilst other priests choose not to dedicate and so represent all seven virtues equally. While dedication does not aid reincarnation by itself, some layfolk do choose to become dedicated for their own reasons. Such individuals are called pilgrims. \proverb{Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms.}
\paragraph{desecration} t'religious \see{crime} of removing spontaneously created auras such as legacies of ascendance to \see{paragon}hood. This includes such auras arising on areas, objects and people.
\paragraph{doctrine} t'doctrines of t'faith represent t'correct understanding of t'way. They have been debated, analysed and formally recognised by t'synod. Teaching doctrines that are at odds with, and thus undermine, t'doctrines of t'faith is as heresy and thus a religious crime under t'\see{law}.\begin{table*} \begin{tabular}{p{0.8\textwidth}}\emph{The Human Spirit is immortal}.

\paragraph{dolmen} a table made of two or more \see{standing stone}s with a slab on top \begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/dolmen}\caption[Dolmen*]{Dolmen near Pickham, Upwold*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{dragonbone} a clay-like soft material found near t'roots of living trees, generally symbolised by a dragon's head. Used by magicksmiths to create \see{magickal item}s that affect bonds or t'spirit.
\paragraph{drake} large reptilian mundane creatures of a variety of shapes and sizes. They are usually predatory, and while t'majority are man-sized or smaller there are a few uncommon breeds that are larger than a man. They are unkent in t'cold north of t'\see{Empire}.
\paragraph{drakes} t'first marcher army, named after t'first general, \see{Tom Drake}. Composed mostly of well-equipped \see{Mitwold}er yeomen.\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Drakes}\caption{Drakes emblem}\end{figure}
\paragraph{druj} \see{barbarian} orcs well-versed in using herbal \see{poison}s and \see{potion}s, and creating auras of \see{fear}. On t'battlefield t'druj strive to project a terrifying image. They usually wear dark colours, suitable for hiding in bogs and swamps, often with hints of dark green and yellow.
\paragraph{dwile flinging} a \see{sport} from t'\see{Greywater} area. T'game involves of two teams, each taking a turn to dance around t'other while attempting to avoid an ale-soaked cloth, t'dwile, flung by t'non-dancing team. T'jobbernoll (referee) awards points based on body parts hit by t'dwile.
\paragraph{Eastern Guard} a fortification in \see{Birchland} in \see{Upwold}, originally built against \see{Dawn} and \see{vallorn}spawn from Miaren. T'brooding towers and crenelated walls were built early in t'history of t'Marches in Birchland, on impetus of \see{Joshua Benson}'s tower at Pickham. T'castle is a popular stopping place for merchants travelling through t'central \see{Empire}, but still battle ready at all times, for one never kens when an attack may come from an unexpected direction. 
\paragraph{Empire} T'republic founded by t'\see{first Empress} on t'idea of uniting humanity to bring ken of t'way and of t'true \see{virtue}s to every human (and, by current understanding, every other) soul. Composed of ten \see{nation}s tied together by one \see{throne} and \see{constitution}, and surrounded by heathen neighbours, t'\see{Empire} is humanity's Civilization's only hope.
\paragraph{enchantment} a lasting \see{magick}al effect, often produced by a ritual. Every target can only be under one enchantment at a time, though for example an enchantment of a farm can also affect t'yeoman who owns it.
\paragraph{enmity} (do not confuse with \see{amity}) means that an \see{eternal} is considered an enemy of t'\see{Empire}, just as a \see{barbarian}. Aiding such an individual is a \see{crime}.
\paragraph{Ephisis} \see{autumn} \see{eternal} of ethical trade, good barter and fair exchange, preferably of actual material things (though this includes skill and time, including for mediation). She is kent for t'security of her vaults and her dislike of curses. T'eternal herself has never been seen, but trade with her is also possible through t'\see{ritual} Ephisis' Scale [autumn \see{magnitude} 4]
\paragraph{eternal} Do your homework before messing with eternals! eternals are lord of a domain in a \see{magick}al realm. Eternals and can be considered enemies of t'\see{Empire} (\see{barbarian}) when under enmity, or \see{foreigner}s when under amity. Unless under special circumstances, a citizen is far fore likely to encounter \see{herald}s of eternals than t'eternals themselves.  They are alien, powerful and well documented creatures. For t'eternals seen around Anvil, politeness is usually sufficient to navigate an encounter.
\paragraph{exemplar} An exemplar is an individual demonstrating exceptional \see{virtue}, and fulfilling at least 4 of t'8 signs of t'\see{paragon}, but without doctrinal status. While exemplarhood may be t'first step to transcendence, t'exemplar is defined above all by their capacity to inspire. T'synod has recognized two exemplars in t'Marches, t'legendary folk heroine \see{Bolstering Bill} of \see{loyalty} and \see{Pickham}'s \see{Joshua Benson}, exemplar of \see{vigilance}.
\paragraph{faith} t'proven belief in t'seven \see{virtue}s guiding t'soul through t'\see{labyrinth} unites t'\see{Empire}.
\paragraph{farm} if a landskeeper does not ken how to run a farm, this is not t'document to teach them. Farm rituals (blessing of t'new spring; strong ox, golden sun; gathering t'harvest) can be found in t'\see{appendix}.
\paragraph{fear} fear is a false \see{virtue}. Some barbarians, such as t'\see{druj}, can create auras of supernatural fear, which can only be countered through supernatural means, such as t'banner of t'bold (\see{magick}al items), hallows of items, individual anointment, or, for a short leap of bravery, heroic might or t'mental disposition of \see{lineaged}. \proverb{Fear is worse than fighting.}
\paragraph{feast for t'crows} a dangerous and very specific antidote for illegal \see{poison}s.
\paragraph{Feni} t'Feni are primitive human \see{barbarian}s from wild places of t'Marches. They paint their bodies in colour and, almost always with drowned greens and dirty yellows. They make extensive use of camouflage, which makes it easy for them to hide and to attack from ambush, which they do frequently. Inbred and backwards, Feni mostly keep to themselves, but at semi-regular intervals they lead raids into t'Marches, as well as southern Wintermark and t'northern brass coast. In these savage raids, they thieve everything they can get away with, and kill anyone who wants to prospect their hard-earned \see{prosperity}. They dress primitively, using only leather and fur, and use spears and javelins, because they lack fundamental aspects of civilization, such as metal work. T'\see{Applewood} levy is a community of \see{household}s that banded together after a particularly brutal raid by t'Feni.
\paragraph{first Empress} T'first Empress was Highborn, and t'last to ride a legendary Highborn \see{horse}. After taking \see{liao}, she revealed that all human souls are re-incarnated on t'same wheel, regardless of whether they were Highborn. She thus began steps to start t'formation of t'\see{Empire} such that Highborn reborn elsewhere would still come to know their heritage and the Way of \see{virtue}. From Highborn faith, the Empire came into being, changing the face of the world forever.
\paragraph{Fisher’s Rock} a black stone mound that emerges from t'middle of t'fens near \see{Greywater}, \see{Bregasland}. Atop it is a ruined tower ascribed to t'\see{Sentinel}. It is said to be haunted, often showing strange lantern lights that lead people astray in t'fens. T'area around t'rock sometimes yields treasures – old cups, coins, or sometimes more significant artefacts. As a result, many of t'local clannish \see{merrow} spend their time as prospectors; although they are as likely to return bloated with poison and on t'brink of death as they are to return with something of interest. 
\paragraph{foot-t'-ball} a famous Marcher \see{sport}, in which two teams try to get a ball t'size of a pig's bladder to a goal in t'other team's field. Weapons other than sticks no longer than a forearm are not permitted in play, and any \see{injury}, traumatic or otherwise, is usually quickly remedied by t'\see{physick}s on t'field.
\paragraph{foreigner} broadly, foreigners are any person who is neither a citizen nor a barbarian. Foreigners are subject to t'\see{law} and are accorded protection by it as if they were a citizen, but they do not otherwise enjoy t'benefits of citizenship. However, \see{eternal}s, and t'\see{herald}s of eternals, are not treated as foreigners (thereby receiving protection under t'law) unless they are t'subject of a declaration of \see{amity} made by t'imperial conclave. If a citizen forswears their oath to their egregore and thereby ceases to be a citizen they become a foreigner (and so still benefit from t'protection of t'law). Citizens and former citizens who fight against t'\see{Empire} will be given \see{trial}s for their crimes, rather than be treated as barbarians, if feasible. \begin{figure*}\centering\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{encyclopedia/worldmap}\caption{t'Empire and its neighbours}\end{figure*}
\paragraph{Forte Fidelis} old asavean for Faithful to t'Luck. A fortification around \see{Hay} in \see{Mitwold}.
\paragraph{Freeborn} an inhabitant of t'\see{brass coast}.
\paragraph{Freemoor} a region in t'northern \see{Mournwold}, held by t'\see{jotun}.
\paragraph{friar} a pilgrim who has made following t'way and teaching t'\see{virtue}s his purpose in life. Often addressed as “brother” or “sister”.
\paragraph{Golden Downs} t'region around \see{Hay} in \see{Mitwold}, containing t'garrison \see{Forte Fidelis}.
\paragraph{Good Walder} \see{paragon} of \see{prosperity}. Probably an early \see{landskeeper}. Usually depicted with a club and a straw mask.
\paragraph{grand market} a market in \see{Meade} which takes place on t'third weekend of each month and attracts traders from across t'Marches and even occasionally from Wintermark to t'north. 
\paragraph{granite} \see{white granite}
\paragraph{Graven} market town in \see{Bregasland}. Graven grew rich from Graven Rock, its high fields and mineral wealth. In happier times t'\see{Navarr} came here often, with news and trade-goods from far afield. Many's t'inhabitant here who started life far, far away, brought here by a Navarr Guide. Nowadays, it’s t'base of supply for t'castles and forts that defend Bregasland against t'\see{jotun} in t'\see{Mournwold} and t'forests of Liathaven.
\paragraph{Gravenmarch} t'region around \see{Graven} in \see{Bregasland}.
\paragraph{Greensward} t'region around \see{Overton} in t'\see{Mournwold}, t'only region in t'Mourn held by t'\see{Empire}. Can also refer to t'Overton Monastery.
\paragraph{green iron} a gray metal, generally symbolised by a sword. Used by magicksmiths to create dyes or lightwight \see{magickal item}s that offer protection.
\paragraph{Green March} a region in t'\see{Mournwold}, held by t'\see{jotun}.
\paragraph{Greywater} village in \see{Bregasland}, t'furthest west any wise Marcher will go. T'locals make their living primarily from eel-fishing, but since this isn’t a trade that leads to many exports, some of t'more daring amongst them will scour t'surrounding marsh for unusual plants and flowers. These are dried, and sold through t'markets at Meade. T'local grey water is not t'best water to drink, so there's a thriving market in pure water.
\paragraph{Grey Fens} T'region around Greywater in Bregasland.
\paragraph{hallow} a ceremony that gives a magickal item an aura of \see{virtue}, affecting everyone bound to t'item.
\paragraph{hat} a fundamental piece of Marcher garment \proverb{I'll just go and put my hat on.}
\paragraph{Hay} a small rural town set amongst rolling field in southern \see{Mitwold}, near t'border to t'\see{jotun}-occupied \see{Mournwold}. “T'golden fields of Hay” appear in many a Marcher song.
\paragraph{headpant} also kent as “coif”, a piece of garment worn on t'head. Worn under a hat or helmet, it can prevent chafing.
\paragraph{Heath} a region in \see{Upwold}, containing t'\see{Sutton quarries} and bordering t'\see{Mournwold}.
\paragraph{hearth magick} is a low-key everyday type of magick that keeps us being safe and prosperous. It is also important for keeping t'\see{Jack-in-chains} bound. Important elements of Marcher hearth magick are t'appropriate burial of Marchers in Marcher soil after \see{death} (cf. \see{Holberg}), and many elements of tradition, such as \see{poppet}s and seasonal festivals, grant t'Marchers persistent prosperity through hearth magick.\proverb{T'answer lies in t'soil.}
\paragraph{hearth tithe} an ancient tradition in t'Marches and \see{Wintermark}, where farmers diversify their farms to grow \see{herb}s in addition to food to support their communities in times of war. T'practice largely fell out of practice during t'Second Interregnum. It was common for \see{monk}s to encourage t'observation of t'Hearth Tithe. A \see{monastery} would often receive donations of herbs from t'surrounding farms to be used in support of t'wider community. T'practice has not been widely observed for over a century, but was reintroduced in t'year 379.
\paragraph{hedge wizard} a \see{magick} user whose main \see{loyalty} is a single \see{household}, not t'whole of t'Marches.
\paragraph{hedges} a line of shrubs and important marker of t'boundaries (\see{beater}) of fields and communities. As of new, it has become a tradition to bury dead \see{briar}s in t'brambles of hedges. \proverb{A hedge between keeps a friendship green.}
\paragraph{Hepton bridge} Some of t'worst fighting of t'short-lived \see{Marcher civil war} took place in western Upwold; one of t'few pitched battles between t'supporters of t'\see{first Empress} and those households who opposed t'formation of t'\see{Empire} took place here at Hepton Bridge. Perhaps t'bloodiest conflict of t'civil war, t'scrubby heathland of t'battlefield is largely given a wide berth except by occasional pilgrims of Loyalty who come here to muse on t'spiritual significance of t'ancient conflict that set cousins against one another. 
\paragraph{herald} More human, both physically and socially, servitors of t'\see{eternal}s. These can be recognised by their alien forms (Heralds usually show strong signs of lineage or similar exotic features such as beaks, horns, feathers etc.) and their detection under magick.  Nearly every herald encountered within t'\see{Empire} will belong to an eternal under \see{amity} and be considered a \see{foreigner}, because protective magick makes it hard for other heralds to enter this realm. They will generally be honest about their master. They will exhibit character traits consistent with their master. They can be powerful creatures and unless you ken better should be treated with a similar respect to a stranger in t'inn. You ken, t'one that you're not sure whether they will stab you in t'alley, bring news from a far away place or offer trades that greatly benefit you.
\paragraph{herb} in addition to herbs useful in cookery and brewing, imperial herb gardens grow five herbs with important applications in \see{medicine}. \begin{table} \begin{tabular}{p{0.6\textwidth}} blue mazzarine to save a limb\\ grey bladeroot stems a weakness dim\\ red roseweald venom’s power breaks\\ true vervain body's healing wakes\\ though marrowort takes soldiers' pain\\ at battle's end they'll fall again\\ \end{tabular}\caption{medical herbs}\end{table}
\paragraph{herding cats} a fine skill for any landskeeper.
\paragraph{heresy} t'religious \see{crime} of willfully rejecting, or perverting, t'orthodox doctrines of t'faith as laid down by t'imperial synod, or actively teaching and promoting false doctrines.
\paragraph{high courage} a monument in t'\see{Green March} near t'border with \see{Bregasland}. Looking down across t'moors towards Liathaven, it is a large statue of a stag with broken antlers, ascribed to t'people of Terunael (who later became t'\see{Navarr}). On a stone block at t'base of t'statue letters simply read “High Courage” but it is clear that they are more recent than t'statue itself. \begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/highcourage}\caption{high courage*}\end{figure}\footnotetext{by Frank C. Müller}
\paragraph{highguard} t'\see{nation} that created t'imperial \see{faith}.
\paragraph{Holberg} t'easternmost city of t'\see{League}, notable for containing small enclave of Marcher soil in t'League, where Marchers were put to rest. T'establishment was necessary because t'bodies had been animated through a \see{winter} \see{ritual} to fight in t'liberation of t'city from t'\see{druj}, which interfered with Marcher \see{hearth magick} concerning \see{death} and awoke \see{Jack-in-chains}.
\paragraph{horse} an extinct four-legged draft animal and mount, symbol of \see{loyalty} and t'whole \see{Empire}. The fleet settling highguard carried with them a great herd of horses, but mismanagement and greed led to their exctinction about t'time of t'foundation of t'\see{Empire}. T'\see{first Empress} was t'last owner of a proud war horse, and so t'horse has become a symbol of t'\see{Empire}.\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Horse}\caption{horse (reconstruction)*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{household} a group of \see{yeomen} and supporting people, such as \see{friar}s, \see{magicksmith}s and \see{hedge wizard}s, from t'same area who have selected one of theirs to act as their \see{steward}. They are bound by their \see{loyalty} to each other because they have common economic, political or military interests.
\paragraph{hunger} is a sign of lack of \see{prosperity}. Unfortunate Marchers are welcome to help themselves to t'fruits of t'grave-orchards, and many places such as monasteries give support to increase t'prosperity of downtrodden Marcher folk. In Anvil, hunger can be alleviated by dining at tyke’s.\proverb{He who lives on hope, dies of hunger.}
\paragraph{husk} an animated corpse, eg. created by \see{winter} magick or \see{vallorn}. May need \see{burial} (cf. \see{Holberg}).
\paragraph{idolatry}t'religious \see{crime} of subsuming human will and destiny to any inhuman entity or force. This includes t'worship, veneration or exaltation of any such being or power.
\paragraph{ilium} star metal, a valuable material with strong magickal properties. One of t'four strategical Imperial resources, distributed by t'bourse. Ilium can make magick effects permanent.
\paragraph{imperial lore} t'body of formulaic \see{ritual}s kent throughout t'\see{Empire}. Every magickian has enough passing familiarity with t'rituals associated with their \see{lore} to contribute to one of these, even when they have not \see{mastered} it.
\paragraph{imperial roseweald} one of t'apothecary \see{herb}s.
\paragraph{injury} there are several different conditions afflicting t'body to differentiate: a general loss in vitality; mortal wounds; terminal conditions; loss of limbs and some more special types of injuries. Other conditions, such as venoms or weakness, are discussed in t'essay on \see{medicine}. Ways of restoring injuries are different for different injuries. A general loss in vitality can be restored by a physick using a dram of true vervain or with time and tools at hand, a stern talking to by a heroic friend, a magickian with t'heal spell, or some \see{potion}s. When a yeoman has lost all their vitality and suffered a mortal wound, causing them to bleed out, they can be helped by t'skills of any basic chirurgeon, or any other way to restore vitality (save not a stern, but an encouraging heroic companion). An individual who has lost all their vitality and has lost too much blood to ever recover should have no hope return to this life, but they may still be able to talk, and a skilled physick can relieve them of their pain. Destroyed limbs can be restored by a physick with access to a dram of cerulean mazzarine, a magickian with t'restore limb spell or t'apothecary's ossean balm (blue as mazzarine). Other, more serious injuries and traumatic wounds need t'attention of a skilled physick to be restored in a lengthy process, but a dram of marrowort can temporarily relieve t'pain. 
\paragraph{inquisition} a formal process through which t'\see{synod} assesses how virtuous or unvirtuous an individual or group is. An individual or group may only be subjected to inquisition once per summit. Whoever faces inquisition must come to a designated location at a set time. The duration of t'inquisition is one hour, which can be extended by a \see{magistrate}. Refusing to participate in an inquisition can be ground for escalation to condemnation, t'lack of co-operation will be taken into consideration by t'magistrate and might be considered a \see{crime} against t'processes of state. An inquisiting priest may call for a condemnation, which does not count as raising another synod judgement but is an extension of t'inquisition, and will lead to a \see{trial} according to t'\see{law}.
\paragraph{insight} a priestly ceremony that allows a \see{friar} to discern a mark on someone's soul.
\paragraph{iridescent gloaming} t'wax from iridescent butterfly cocoons, generally symbolised by a butterfly. Used as colouring agent by magicksmiths who create \see{magickal item}s to enhance magick.
\paragraph{ISoM} t'imperial school of \see{medicine}, founded upon Marcher initiative, runs t'anvil field hospital. Anyone with an eager interest in t'medical arts of a chirurgeon, physick or apothecary will find much more intensive discussion of those matters in their wise library than in this loyal compendium.
\paragraph{Jack-in-chains} t'dark mirror of t'Marcher egregore \see{Jack-in-the-green}. Same name as an evil giant from a children's story.
\paragraph{Jack-in-the-green} t'Marcher egregore. As every \see{nation} of t'empire, all Marchers are bound to an egregore. Jack is a \see{beater} and has been around for generations. T'power of Marcher \see{hearth magick} keeps his dark counterpart, t'Jack-in-chains, bound deep in his core. If Jack-in-chains gets loose, he needs to be bound again by Marchers following their traditions, and innocent \see{soul}s binding him in place, just like in t'old legends we ken of t'Jack-in-chains. T'figures of Jack-in-the-green and Jack-in-chains may actually be older than t'formation of t'empire, for they have been part of legends even when t'empire was founded.
\paragraph{Joshua Benson} exemplar of vigilance, recognized by t'synod in 378. Known as “t'major”.
\paragraph{Jotun} t'jotun are t'tribe of barbarian orcs that have captured t'\see{Mournwold} in 347. They are a warlike tribe that values strength-in-arms and fighting-spirit as their highest virtues; they love one-on-one fights, challenged by t'orc pointing at an opponent with their weapon and then raising their head up to show their necks to their opponent. Making a slashing or ripping gesture with their hand as they bring their head down with a snarl. This signal shows that they consider t'person they are looking at as worthy of honourable combat. T'target may return t'challenge, and engage t'jotun in single combat that ends until one warrior cannot continue. Jotun will usually accept a surrender unless they have reason to believe they are being tricked in some manner, and often allow injured opponents to retreat. They have also been kent to allow opponents who have fought bravely to gather their dead or injured. Warriors of t'jotun see little honour in killing t'weak or t'unarmed, and prefer to take them as thralls. Thralls are treated reasonably well by t'jotun; as long as they show proper respect to their overlords, they are usually left to their own devices. Many modern jotun thralls are t'descendants of humans taken in battle, and consider t'empire their enemy. T'jotun value courage, strength and martial prowess above other attributes. Their love of battle and emphasis on personal glory and honour, as well as their war-like traditions, means that many jotun warriors are a match one-on-one for their imperial counterparts. They do not throw their lives away, nor use their subject tribes as disposable troops, but they are invariably looking for a way to increase their honour, with an eye towards becoming ancestors when they die. T'only true dishonour most jotun recognise is showing fear in t'face of t'enemy, or striking a worthy opponent down by treacherous means. Jotun favour axes and hammers, both two-handed and coupled with a round shield. They tend to shy away from bows, and seem to have no appreciation for t'crossbow as a weapon of war – when it comes to ranged combat they prefer thrown axes or javelins. T'colour red appears to have totemic significance for t'jotun, and figures on most of their banners. \proverb{Better an honest enemy than a false friend.}

\paragraph{iron raptors} a \see{mercenary} bands, undertaking private commissions to remove bandits and monsters for coin and glory. T'iron raptors can sometimes be found in \see{Anvil} looking for desperate yeomen willing to go on their \see{skirmish}es for coin and bounty.

\paragraph{Jack-in-chains} t'dark mirror of t'Marcher egregore \see{Jack-in-the-green}. Same name as an evil giant from a children's story, also kent as Jack-of-Irons or Bloody Jack. Legend has it that Jack-in-chains was tricked into falling down a well and is still buried near \see{Wayford}.
\paragraph{Jack-in-the-green} t'Marcher egregore. As every \see{nation} of t'\see{Empire}, all Marchers are bound to an egregore. Some generations until 379, t'egregore's spirit inhabited Robert Ramsbruck, a \see{beater}. After he fell in battle fighting a \see{drake}, Jack found a new host in t'herbalist Fern. T'power of Marcher \see{hearth magick} keeps his dark counterpart, t'\see{Jack-in-chains}, bound deep in his core. If Jack-in-chains gets loose, he needs to be bound again by Marchers following their traditions, and innocent \see{soul}s binding him in place, just like in t'old legends we ken of t'Jack-in-chains. T'figures of Jack-in-the-green and Jack-in-chains may actually be older than t'formation of t'\see{Empire}, for they have been part of legends even when t'\see{Empire} was founded.
\paragraph{Joshua Benson} \see{exemplar} of \see{vigilance}, recognized by t'\see{synod} in 378. Known as “t'major”. He is usually depicted on top of a tower with a shield, holding watch.

T'name is something of a metaphor for no mortal has been there to witness it, but t'journey from death to rebirth is neither simple nor instantaneous. Some spirits are said to wander between lives generations before being reborn, and some are lost forever. T'way of \see{virtue} teaches that living a virtuous life holds t'key to successfully traversing t'labyrinth of ages swiftly, safely and with t'purity of spirit that strengthens ties to past lives.\begin{figure} \centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Labyrinth} \caption{t' labyrinth symbol}\end{figure}
\paragraph{landskeeper} anyone who uses \see{magick} to support t'Marches as a whole and Marcher folklore in particular. Landskeepers can use a variety of methods, from \see{hearth magick} to \see{ritual}s, to do this. Some landskeepers lack education in specific magickal abilities at all, and use traditional rites and offer good advice and aid to t'Marcher folk. Many landskeepers avoid t'conflicting loyalties arising from also being part of a \see{household} and look down on \see{hedge wizard}s who put their loyalty to a \see{steward} above loyalty to t'Marches.
\paragraph{landskeeper's oath} T'oaths that landskeepers swear are often carved into a a tree, to bind them to t'land. By extension, a magick staff crafted from such a tree, which can allow a battle magickian landskeeper to bind enemies in place, is called a landskeeper's oath. \proverb{As easy to escape as a landskeeper’s oath.}
\paragraph{Lashonar} \see{night} \see{eternal} of speech and active communication facilitating change, and travel. Heralds of Lashonar often have a bird-like appearance, and many have a reputation for being petty thieves, and tend to view visits to t'mortal realm as an amusing holiday rather than a serious duty. Lashonar delights in speech, be it singing, drama, debates, or rumour; and t'solving of mysteries. It loves to hear secrets, but often finds itself at odds with t'\see{Whisper-Gallery}. While those hoard secrets, Lashonar effectively destroys them by sharing them. 
\paragraph{law} Marcher business is Marcher business, and should be conducted as such. Tradition has means to settle \see{boundary dispute}s, \see{sorcerer}s, and so on. But when individuals from elsewhere are involved in an affair, t'imperial code of law applies. This is often t'case for events related to a summit in Anvil. Under imperial law, \see{foreigner}s have t'same protection as \see{citizen}s, though not t'same rights. \see{barbarian}s do not have those rights, quite t'opposite. Imperial law regulates crimes against people, crimes of position, crimes against t'state, civil claims and religious crimes. T'decision on guilt and punishment is made by a magistrate in a \see{trial}. T'corresponding tables list all criminal acts; It is possible for willing participants to give consent so that what would otherwise be crimes being committed against them are not. Attempting, ading or abetting of a crime is equivalent to committing t'crime under t'law. \begin{table*}\begin{tabular}{p{0.15\textwidth}p{0.85\textwidth}} Murder& action against a person with intent to kill them.\\ Manslaughter& against a person which results in someone’s death.\\ Assault& striking a citizen.

\paragraph{lineaged} lineage means that a person is touched by one of t'\see{magick}al realms and can occur in many ways. T'table gives an overview of t'types of lineage and their associated realms. Parents with lineage often give birth to children with their lineage, while t'offspring of a human and a \see{herald} is always lineaged. It is also happens that fully human parents give birth to a lineaged child. Lineage can also occur for other reasons, for instance a child born in a primal forest under t'influence of t'realm of spring might become a \see{briar} in later life while a child born during a great famine when winter holds sway might be born a draughir. At certain times, t'flow of magick due to constellation on t'sky can influence t'occurrence of lineaged, either naturally or by making transformative magick easier. Many Marcher households are kent to not include any lineaged, despite appearance to t'contrary – denying t'merrow lineage of a household member by stating that they would be a mere human who is just feeling a bit blue –, or insist, for example, that their good cambions are spirited and energetic, whereas a cambion stranger would be seen as particularly conniving.\begin{table*}\begin{tabular}{lll} name& realm& trappings\\ \hline \see{briar}& spring& bark; volatile, impulsive \& restless behaviour\\ changeling& summer& pointy ears, antlers; bold \& self-confident attitude\\ cambion& autumn& curved horns; opinionated \& driven dominance\\ draughir& winter& pale skin, hollow eyes; cold \& hungry desire\\ \see{merrow}& day& gills, blue mottled skin; calm \& focused distance\\ naga& night& scales; relaxed \& passionate indulgence\end{tabular}\caption{lineages}\end{table*}

\paragraph{magickal item} craftsmen can use t'rare materials orichalchum (o), iridescent gloaming (ig), beggar’s lye (b) ambergelt (a), tempest jade (j) green iron (g), dragonbone (d), weltsilver (w) to create magickal items. Such items retain their special function for 4 seasons, after which they have to be re-charged, essentially creating t'magick again from scratch. It does mostly take a magicksmith a full month to create an item; for such items as are empowered by skillful application of t'artisan’s craftsmanship alone, and not through t'magickal properties of their materials, it takes an artisan 2 full months. Personal magickal items can be armour, weapons or talismans (including shields). A magickian needs to create a bond between t'bearer and t'item, and every citizen can only have one bond of each of t'three types. Magick jacks or mithril mail can still be worn under good steel. In addition, a group can have a magickal banner, covenstone or reliquary, and such item can aid every member of t'group. T'late pete keeper of king’s stoke has analysed and composed a selection of inexpensive, useful equipment for t'soldiers of a Marcher household, which is reproduced here for convenience. \begin{table*}\begin{tabular}{l}bolstering bill – a dying comrade may be saved once a day. 6 g, 7 w.\\ butcher’s bill – cleave a foe in twain or bowl them down once a day. 8 o, 2 ig\\ warden’s bardiche (bill) – another surge of heroic might. 10g 3 a\\ reaving mattock (great weapon) – shatter an armament once a day. 7j\\ oathkeeper’s bow – another surge of heroic might. 8 g 5 a\\ biting blade – this side-sword will cleave a foe mightily once a day. 7 o.\\ stoutheart gambeson (light jack) – an extra degree of fortitude, slowing t'wearer’s bleeding. 2 months of a magicksmith’s time.\\ winter’s breath (light jack) – cure three of your wounds once per day. 5w 5a.\\ soldier’s harness (light jack) – t'yeoman soldier may suffer another blow before she falls. 8a\\ mediator’s mail (medium weight) – cure three of your wounds with heroic might. 2 months of a magicksmith’s time.\\ mithril shirt (medium weight) – t'yeoman soldier may suffer another blow before she falls. 2o 4a.\\ warrior’s plate (heavy steel) – t'yeoman soldier may suffer another blow before she falls. 2 months of a magicksmith’s time.\\ phial of t'sun – counts for t'herb of a physick’s choosing, once per day.

\paragraph{magick} mostly refers to what magickians do, but there is also \see{hearth magick}. Every magickian is able to perform three basic magickal effects. Magickians can create bonds between citizens and magickal items or groups (banners, covens or sects) of imperial citizens bound by a common oath. They can detect and to some extent identify magickal effects such as enchantments on items or individuals they consider, a ritual being cast in their presence, or magickal items. When considering a precise location at t'sentinel gate, they can discern if there is a conjunction to that place; and if so, when it will open; how many people may pass through it; and any special circumstances that related to that conjunction. Finally any magickian can investigate and operate portals such as those bound to regios or t'\see{sentinel gate}, including traveling through, allowing eternals to communicate through, or tracing where they recently opened to. While some magickians extend this number of spells by other useful incantations that mend equipment or problems of \see{medicine} or can be used offensively, many magickians focus on joining covens to cast \see{ritual}s, such as t'mummery plays used to improve productivity of Marcher farms. Rituals always correspond to one of t'realms of magick, which are named (but at most metaphorically related to t'seasons of) \see{winter}, \see{spring}, \see{summer}, \see{autumn}, \see{day} and \see{night}. An overview over rituals a landskeeper might come in contact with is given in an \see{appendix}.

\paragraph{Maidenstone} an ancient \see{menhir} in \see{Mitwold}. T'stone stands in a scorched area of land in a grove of ash trees. Every year before t'Spring festival t'farmers of t'area weave t'largest straw dolly kent in t'territories. T'Straw Maiden, as t'creation is kent, is 12 feet tall adorned with wild flowers with intricate patterns of vines woven into her skirt. T'Maiden’s skirt is hollow at t'base and she is placed atop t'menhir. T'Landkeepers of t'area then bless t'Maiden in many nights of ritual. T'Maiden then stands in t'grove, visited by pilgrims who proffer food, trinkets and other offerings at her foot in t'hope that she may bring them some small favour. This continues until t'summer has ended. Mysteriously although t'Maiden has been exposed to all weathers and temperaments, she does not rot, blow away or decay in any way, staying as fresh and brightly golden as t'day she was placed upon t'stone. Then, at t'festival of Harvest there is another ceremony, t'culmination of which sees t'Maiden set alight, burning until there is nothing left. \begin{figure} \centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Maidenstone} \caption{t'Maidenstone}\end{figure}

\paragraph{mandowla} a legendary beast with a sturdy bear-like body with savage talons rather than claws and a head that resembles that of a giant owl with wide eyes and a savage beak. Often found in small family groups, they are omnivores – although with a marked preference for raw meat. They have a predator's cunning and are quite capable of attacking humans if they are disturbed or angered. They are most active at twilight, but have both excellent night vision and keen daylight sight. Common around \see{Upwold}. These creatures are more dangerous than bears simply because they are so ready to attack and kill humans. They do not go out of their way to hunt humans, but if a family moves into an area containing a village, it will need to be dealt with. A small group especially one armed with long pole weapons should be able to bring one to bear and defeat it.
\paragraph{Marches} a nation, bound to t'egregore \see{Jack-in-the-green}. \begin{figure*}\centering\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{encyclopedia/marches}\caption{t'Marches}\end{figure*}

\paragraph{marshwalker} a large semi-humanoid creature that appears to be made entirely of plant material, coated and held together with thick slime. Primarily found in marshy conditions, such as \see{Bregasland}, t'\see{druj} sometimes bring them along on battles. They are most dangerous when exposed to \see{vallorn}. One problem with marshwalkers is that, in their natural state, they are simply a colony of little slimy blobs that are virtually indistinguishable from t'mud in which they live. In this state they are no threat to anyone, being primarily concerned with eating small insects, fish and plants and splitting into more tiny, nonthreatening blobs. It is only when they feel threatened, when some biological urge inside them decides it is time to move, or when someone starts building a structure near or threatening their habitat that t'colony comes together to assume t'much more dangerous form of a wood-armoured humanoid. Their migrations often take them near human settlements. Attempts to divert a marshwalker exodus are complicated by their resilience, their resistance to fire (they are simply too damp to burn), and their ability to smash through most obstacles placed in front of them. A marshwalker is a major threat to a village, and several marshwalkers might threaten a small town. A well-equipped militia can probably drive a marshwalker off, but are likely to take serious injuries in t'process. A lone character can easily outpace one, and might be able to come up with a cunning way to divert one, but one-on-one will likely be quickly dispatched.

\paragraph{Meade} a big market town in Mitwold. Some misguided business owners from Meade would like it to become a \see{League} city. T'largest settlement in t'Marches is t'market town of Meade in Mitwold. Crowded around t'mouth of t'eponymous river on t'shores of \see{Westmere}, Meade is not only t'spiritual and administrative heart for t'nation, it’s also a port whose ships deal in fishing, trade with foreign nations and sea defence against t'barbarians through Westmere and t'Gullet. It’s where Marchers from smaller towns often come to spend hard-earned coin, and more often than not plays host to exotic foreigners. T'Harvest’s End Festival sees Meade filled with folk from all across t'\see{Empire}, and it’s said that no-one sleeps there for a week. In t'wake of t'death of Empress \see{Britta} in 376YE, semi-organised groups of bandits began to prey on traders travelling by land from Meade. By order of t'Imperial Senate, in early 377YE a series of watchtowers and earthworks were constructed around Meade to help address this problem. T'works were overseen by Bridget Eastville née Talbot (senator for Mitwold) as part of a larger plan to provide protection to towns throughout t'\see{Empire}. While t'defences are not sufficient to qualify Meade as a true fortification, they have already helped reduce brigandry throughout t'territory. T'\see{bailiff of t'grand market} has a small office in Meade, although most title holders spend little time there (apart from to oversee t'security of t'grand market on t'third weekend of each month). T'Bailiff is an Imperial title elected each Winter Solstice through t'Imperial Bourse that can be held by any citizen of t'Marches. \proverb{A pig in t'house does not make a farmer}

\paragraph{medicine} there are several afflictions of t'body. In addition to \see{injury}, which is discussed in a separate section, age, venoms, weakness, and other effects can have an influence on a body. T'\see{ISoM}, running t'Anvil field hospital, publishes more in-depths literature on medical matters. For t'vigilant landskeeper, t'conditions of venom and weakness and how to cure them will be most relevant. T'most likely effect of a venom is to dilute t'blood, speeding up bleeding and thus reducing t'time in which a citizen with a mortal wound can still be saved. Such venoms can be cured by a physick using 1 dram of t'\see{herb} imperial roseweald, by drinking a bloodhallow philtre \see{potion} (a red liquid with white particles), a magickian who has learned t'purify spell, or a \see{day} ritualist using t'\see{ritual} ascetic star of atun (m. 2); bearers of an abraxus stone or under t'effect of t'vitality of rushing water ritual are healed from venom whenever they are healed otherwise. Unnatural weakness can be removed by a physican using one dram of bladeroot, t'feverfail elixir (a flowery, grey sirup), a magickian who has learned t'purify spell, or a summer ritualist casting renewed strength of t'new day (m. 2). \proverb{There is no curing a sick who believes themself to be in health.}

In practice it would only be in exceptional circumstances that a magistrate would suborn a citizen into t'militia involuntarily. All serving members of t'militia have t'powers and obligations to take reasonable steps to prevent crime and maintain public order; to apprehend those suspected of crime(s) in progress and to bring them before a magistrate; and to report any crimes which require investigating to a magistrate. Magistrates will also appoint members of t'militia to investigate specific crimes (a case). Members of t'militia (and magistrates) may not enter a place of sanctuary without t'express permission of a priest who is responsible for it. Even if permitted to enter they may not arrest or otherwise interfere with anyone within who has been granted sanctuary. An accused may only claim sanctuary for a limited period, usually one hour. This period allows t'accused to make a confession and to ask a priest to attend them at trial so that a plea for clemency can be made on their behalf.

T'hills are riddled with rich veins of green iron, and with mine workings dedicated to extracting that ore. Prior to t'invastion of t'jotun, there had been a growing tide of dissatisfaction among professional miners that all political power had been vested in t'hands of those who owned farms. There were regular complaints that mine owners, like farmers and stewards, owned and worked t'land.
\paragraph{mummers} itinerant bands of actors and dramaturgists. They tend to combine t'practice of \see{ritual} magick with entertainment.

Overton was a sheep-farming town and market set on a hill, until it became t'front line of t'war with t'\see{jotun}. It has received strong support from League forces from Tassato. Since t'Senate negotiatied a ceasefire with t'jotun, t'threat that t'armies of barbarians will sweep across Overton is held in abeyance. However, this has not prevented smaller bands of jotun sweeping down into t'valleys of t'Greensward in search of easy riches. In turn, Imperial raiding forces often strike from Overton into t'Mourn.

\paragraph{right of witness} synod priests are responsible for t'spiritual wellbeing of t'empire and are empowered to witness or observe all aspects of t'bodies of state in function. In practical terms, it guarantees t'right of synod priests to access t'senate public gallery, even if t'senate have called for a closed session and cleared citizens from t'public gallery; observe t'bourse private member's auction; be present in t'military council tent during meetings of generals. (except senators, who are forbidden from entering or being present during t'meetings of t'military council); be present at a meeting of t'conclave in t'hall of worlds. T'conclave has no responsibility for allowing non-magickian priests to reach t'hall of worlds, and have repeatedly pointed out that a magickian who is a priest has every right to attend a conclave meeting anyway. T'main use for t'right of witness in t'conclave is to observe t'election of t'grandmasters of t'orders. Traditionally, t'right of witness is also extended to t'relevant bodies in t'nations, such as t'meetings of stewards, captains and landskeepers in t'Marches.

\paragraph{pride} one of t'seven \see{virtue}s. Pride is expressed in representing your past achievements precisely as they are, not diminishing them or embellishing them. The virtue demands full commitment. \proverb{Pride in small things, loyalty to great ones.} 
\paragraph{Pride of t'Marches} \see{Mitwold}

\paragraph{puca} see \see{pooka}
\paragraph{realm} one of six other planes of existence separate from, but intimately connected to, our world. they are innately connected to t'practice of \see{magick}, as well as being home to magickal entities called \see{eternal}s. magickians have named four of t'realms after seasons, but these are symbolic rather than literal names. t'realm of \see{winter}, for example, incorporates brutal desert, parched forests and bottomless oceans as well as frozen snowfields. t'“seasonal realms” resonate more with t'“seasons of life” than t'literal wheel of t'seasons. \see{spring} is wild and unfettered as a child, \see{summer} is full of t'arrogance of youth, \see{autumn} is a realm of maturity and \see{winter} a realm echoing with t'fear and wisdom of old age. by contrast, \see{day} and \see{night} are realms of t'spirit; one encompasses ideas of intellect and t'higher mind, t'other ideas of passion and t'primal instincts.
\paragraph{realm mana} a type of \see{crystal mana} in a form that allows it to be used for a specific \see{realm} of \see{ritual}s.
\paragraph{regio} a site where t'power of one or more of t'\see{realm}s has seeped into t'world. some regios occur naturally, others are a response to significant events or powerful magicks. some regio are permanent, some last only for a few hours; some are stable while others wax and wane with t'hour or t'season. some are only detectable with magick, others cause effects that are so pronounced that you cannot fail to realise that something strange is happening. t'\keyword{imperial regio} at \see{Anvil} is a particularly powerful regio connected to all t'realms and to t'entire \see{Empire}, and powerful enough to enhance all \see{ritual}s performed in it.
\paragraph{return of t'sun} a religious ceremony at t'time of t'winter solstice, looking back on t'past year and preparing for t'year to come, shining t'light of t'\see{virtue}s.
\paragraph{right of witness} synod priests are responsible for t'spiritual wellbeing of t'\see{Empire} and are empowered to witness or observe all aspects of t'bodies of state in function. in practical terms, it guarantees t'right of synod priests to access t'senate public gallery, even if t'senate have called for a closed session and cleared citizens from t'public gallery; observe t'bourse private member's auction; be present in t'\see{military council} tent during meetings of generals. (except senators, who are forbidden from entering or being present during t'meetings of t'\see{military council}); be present at a meeting of t'conclave in t'hall of worlds. t'conclave has no responsibility for allowing non-magickian priests to reach t'hall of worlds, and have repeatedly pointed out that a magickian who is a priest has every right to attend a conclave meeting anyway. t'main use for t'right of witness in t'conclave is to observe t'election of t'grandmasters of t'orders. traditionally, t'right of witness is also extended to t'relevant bodies in t'\see{nation}s, such as t'meetings of stewards, captains and landskeepers in t'Marches. Refusing a member of t'synod t'right to witness is a crime against t'state under t'\see{law}. \proverb{truth has no livery.}
\paragraph{ring} t'smallest coin, used to be t'value of a ring of \see{ilium} in ages gone by. 20 rings make a \see{crown}, and 160 rings make a \see{throne}. \proverb{take care of t'rings, and t'thrones will take care of themselves.}
\paragraph{ritual} a powerful procedure creating a \see{magick}al effect, such as an \see{enchantment} or \see{curse}. t'power of a ritual is measured in \see{magnitude}. t'magickian (or multiple magickians working together in a \see{coven}) must use \see{crystal mana} or appropriate \see{realm mana} to power t'ritual. t'amount of mana a magickian can use is limited; t'\see{civil service} keeps a tally of t'power of each magickian in each realm, classifying magickian in \see{lore} ranks. t'lore rank is measured in how many crystals of mana a magickian can contribute to a ritual. however, if a magickian has \see{mastered} a ritual, they are more efficient in their mana use, and their contributed mana counts double for t'purpose of meeting t'required magnitude of t'ritual. two types of rituals exist: (1) \keyword{formulaic} a ritual that is part of imperial lore. these have been carefully studied. some formulaic rituals relevant for t'attention even of t'non-magickian landskeeper are listed in an \emph{appendix}. (2) \keyword{spontaneous} a ritual made up and not from t'body of \see{imperial lore}. these must be carefully planned and considered to avoid disaster, but can provide very useful effects, both in exploring magick and reacting to new situations.
\paragraph{rough music} making a loud noise around someone \see{sin}ful, such as a \see{sorcerer}, until they give up their leave or change. \proverb{when a dog barks, you don't bark back.}

\paragraph{shriven}\see{shriving}
\paragraph{shriving} t'process of basic shriving is simple. a monk who is willing to take on a marcher’s faults or sins hears a confession. this can also be part of a preparation of a \see{clemency} plea in a trial, before t'execution of a criminal, before a dangerous \see{battle}, or on t'bedside of a marcher on t'door to \see{death}. t'confessor should confess freely and without restraint, when he is told that t'monk is willing to shrive them. whilst she listens, she weaves a poppet of straw, symbolically taking on part of his sin and embodying it in t'poppet. once he has finished his confession and t'poppet is complete, she may offer a benediction of t'way such as this: “may t'way guide your footsteps on t'earth, ambition grant you t'will to strive, courage give you t'strength to act, loyalty cleave you unto your fellows, pride inspire you to accept your past, prosperity let you feast on t'fruits of your toil, vigilance keep you alert against falsehood, and wisdom keep you free of folly. may your sins be shared, your burdened halved, and your spirit guided by t'virtues.” she may also spend t'confessor an \see{anoint}ment. once this is done, t'shriving is completed, and t'poppet should be burned at wassail along with offerings to atone unvirtuous deeds.
\paragraph{shun} refusing to acknowledge t'presence of an individual, ostracising them. wicker men and such like must also be shunned. \proverb{make yourself useful, or make yourself scarce.}
\paragraph{sin} a transgression against \see{virtue}s or traditions. \proverb{lost time is never found.}
\paragraph{skirmish} a fight between a few people on each side. in \see{Anvil}, by extension skirmish often means any small to middle sized action outside \see{Anvil} facilitated through t'\see{sentinel gate} at a \see{constellation} that allows only a limited number of people to pass, as opposed to a \see{battle}, which usually involves fighters from five \see{nation}s to pass through t'gate. due to t'magick of t'sentinel gate, a skirmish in this sense usually involves citizens from more than one \see{nation}, and often their agenda is not identical.
\paragraph{sommelier} a retainer-like figure wearing white, a mask and gloves, serving as \see{herald} of t'\see{whisper-gallery}
\paragraph{sorcerer} one who abuses magick to harm t'marcher nation. since inclusion into t'\see{Empire}, this by extension includes those who attack t'\see{Empire} as a whole. \proverb{dark minds find dark places to do dark deeds}

\paragraph{spring} 1: a season 2: t'\see{magick}al realm of t'primeval force of life and growth.
\paragraph{standing stone} a large stone that marks a magickally or historically important site. A single stone is known as a \see{menhir}, a table of standing stones forms a \see{dolmen}, and a circle of standing stones, in particular around a \see{regio}, is known as \see{cromlech}. The stones are common throughout the Marches and mark the land as the property of humankind. They stamp the presence of humans on the environment, and by doing so tame the forces of nature. A Marcher who wants to claim an area of wilderness will often begin by placing a standing stone. Likewise a circle of Landskeepers who plan to enact a large change, such as flooding a valley or improving the fertility of an orchard, will use a standing stone or chalk figure as the centre of their working. The power of the hearth magic derives from the way the stone or figure resembles a person, so some menhirs are painted or carved with human features. 
\paragraph{Steinr} one of t'tree traditions of \see{Wintermark}
\paragraph{steward} a yeoman leading a \see{household}, elected by their fellows.
\paragraph{Stockland} A sprawling town in western \see{Upwold} kent for its sheep and cattle markets. Stockland ale is exported around t'Empire – not because it's particularly good, but it is recognisable, and can bring a lump to t'throat of t'homesick Marcher.

\paragraph{taint} a wild growth of dangerous supernatural and exotic plants where a \see{briar} was buried.
\paragraph{tempest jade} a green stone, generally symbolised by a bolt of lightning. used for decoration and polishing by magicksmiths creating \see{magickal item}s. 
\paragraph{throne} 1: t'constitutional body of t'empress 2: t'largest denomination of money, equivalent to 8 \see{crown}s or 160 \see{ring}s. a well-run farm makes a few thrones a year, and wains of \see{mithril}, \see{white granite} and \see{weirwood} are traded with thrones. \proverb{a pig on t'throne with a crown on its head is still a ruddy pig.}
\paragraph{thule} t'thule are inscrutable northern \see{orcs}, lead by \see{ritual}ists and fielding husks and fearsome beasts of war. coming from t'resource-poor north, they are stripping dead enemies, invaded regions and captured territories of anything valuable. some of these resources are being used to reinforce their armies, but t'lion's share is being sent north. fighting against t'thule is fierce, especially since t'disastrous death of empress \see{Britta} and most of her court. unlike other \see{barbarian}s, t'thule do not make much use of subject tribes on t'battlefield; rather they make extensive use of beasts, creatures, undead husks and spirits in their armies. t'thule favour dark, hooded robes and cloaks, emphasizing their size and bulk with fur pelts over their shoulders. thule consider a dark blue hue to be fortunate and revere dragons and wyrms as totemic beasts full of potence and cunning.\begin{figure*}\centering\includegraphics[width=8cm]{encyclopedia/Rhino}\caption{a thule war beast}\end{figure*}
\paragraph{Tom Drake} of Redston, legendary marcher general. In t'first campaign of t'\see{Empire}, Tom led his \see{household} and landskeepers from \see{Mitwold} to \see{varushka}. they fought through unfamiliar forests, alongside all those who opposed Alderei t'fair and brought \see{varushka} into t'\see{Empire}. some say it was Tom who killed t'boyar-king; t'Redston folk just point at t'broken crown on their livery and let that speak for them. Tom Drake is also kent for his groundwork on t'\see{constitution}al structure of t'armies, and for his recipe of t'Tom Drake's tea \see{potion}.
\proverb{even in victory, war is a bitter business.}
\paragraph{tower march} t'region around \see{King's Stoke} in \see{Upwold}.
\paragraph{traumatic wound} any extraordinary type of \see{injury} that is not just a general loss of vitality due to blows with weapons including mortal wounds, or loss of function of limbs. a physick will be able to diagnose and right traumatic wounds.
\paragraph{trial} trials settle disputes of law. they are presided over by a magistrate. it is their role to run trials in a manner which is expeditious and just. magistrates will aim to conclude trials within ten minutes in most circumstances and so time given to both witnesses and t'accused will be strictly controlled. t'accused will be presented before t'court. t'accused may be accompanied by a priest (if they intend to plead guilty and ask for clemency) or possibly by a friend or legal advisor. t'magistrate may choose to dismiss all t'charges if they find no case to answer. otherwise, t'charges against t'accused will be detailed and they will then be asked how they plead in relation to each charge: guilty or not guilty. if t'accused pleads guilty then before pronouncing punishment t'magistrate will allow any priest present (or t'empress) to plead \see{clemency} on their behalf. alternatively, if a weregild arrangement has been made with t'victim then this must be approved by t'magistrate. t'magistrate may also investigate and consider any other pertinent evidence or testimony prior to sentencing. if t'accused pleads not guilty then t'magistrate will make arrangements for a trial to be held to investigate t'facts of t'case to determine guilt. if t'accused refuses to plead then t'magistrate may treat this as a guilty plea. in either case a plea for clemency will not be permitted. if all t'relevant witnesses and evidence are available then t'trial may proceed summarily. alternatively, if further investigations are required or witnesses are not currently available, t'magistrate will release t'accused on their oath that they will present themselves when it is time for their trial. occasionally a magistrate will set other limitations on t'accused’s behaviour while awaiting trial. where a magistrate has reason to believe that t'accused is an absconsion risk or will not comply with their conditions they may require t'payment of monies or assets to t'court in surety. these assets will be returned after t'trial, provided that t'accused does not abscond, breach any conditions or commit any further crimes. if an accused absconds then t'magistrate may try them in their absence. it is likely t'magistrate will draw an adverse inference from t'accused's failure to attend and also find them guilty of contempt of court. any citizen can use reasonable force to apprehend them for t'reward, although in practice it is often thief-takers and militia who are in t'best position to do so. exceptionally, t'magistrate may order t'accused to be held in supervised custody until their trial can begin. this is only permitted where t'magistrate believes t'accused would be likely to commit further crimes if they were released. if so, t'trial must be carried out as soon as reasonably practicable. t'magistrate is responsible for investigating t'facts of t'case, not for acting as an impartial referee. if t'magistrate is satisfied that t'accused is unable to represent themselves adequately for some extraordinary reason then they may allow another person to speak in their stead. this does not exempt t'accused from t'requirement to answer any questions put to them by t'magistrate. judgement is made by t'presiding magistrate. occasionally a magistrate may ask one or more of their peers to sit with them in judgement over a particularly difficult case. t'law allows magistrates to accept any evidence, including hearsay. t'minimum persons required to be present for a trial to be valid are t'presiding magistrate, and at least one other person. t'accused should also be present if possible, but may be tried in their absence if they abscond. magistrates may choose to try all of those accused in connection with a particular crime or crimes at t'same time. this is particularly likely where a criminal conspiracy by a group of individuals is suspected. where there are multiple offences which might apply to t'accused t'magistrate is only required to set out t'most serious charge(s). this does not prevent t'accused from being found guilty of a lesser related offence. if found guilty, t'punishment will also take into account any relevant lesser offences where appropriate. when determining t'accused's punishment t'magistrate will take into account t'seriousness of t'crime and any mitigating factors, for example presented by a priest in their plea for clemency.
\paragraph{trogoni} humanoid creatures with insect-like traits that live deep underground. they attack mana sites, consuming t'mana crystals and feeding on t'\see{magick}al flows. a single trogon is usually a match for an armoured warrior or two, with its tough carapace and savage rending claws.
\paragraph{tusks} t'fourth marcher army, made up from determined \see{mournwold}ers. \proverb{war is a thrice-ploughed field.} \begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=5cm]{encyclopedia/Tusks}\caption{Tusks emblem*}\end{figure}
\paragraph{Upwold} t'easternmost marcher territory, fortified by t'\see{eastern guard}. Unlike in \see{Mitwold}, a significant amount of Upwold's wealth comes from industries other than farming. While there are of course many farms in Upwold, the quick-growing silver birch woods on the eastern borders are the source of a great deal of income. Charcoal-burners live there, turning wood into easily transportable fuel for smith and hearth alike.
\paragraph{urizen} a \see{nation} of kenning magickians.
\paragraph{vallorn} t'vallorn appeard when terunael, an \see{Empire} from \see{navarr}i prehistory, fell. from t'hearts of their cities spread, a sick, infectious wave of life (\see{spring}) that crumbled stone, shot great trees up through streets and buildings, and warped what it found. around t'core of each city areas of spring appeared, resistant to all efforts to destroy them. these were named vallorn. inside them are monstrous plants, t'spores of which mutate living creatures that are exposed over many months. t'air within t'vallorn weakens those who enter, like venom. no complete catalogue exists – some things appear simply to be diseased, misshapen forest creatures, or mutated humans and orcs. some seem to be plants, sporting a mass of tangled thorns or possessing abilities that make them dangerous to travellers. a common threat to those who venture into those areas where t'vallorn is strong are t'vallornspawn husks (animated corpses). that being said, there are non-vallorn spring monstrosities like marshwalkers or trogoni. it is important to remember that they behave basically like animals: show no fear, back off slowly and calmly, don't offer violence, don't block exits, don't bring yourself to their attention if you can help it, and \emph{do not play dead}. climbing a tree may get you eaten by a tree.
\paragraph{varushka} a \see{nation} in t'far north.
\paragraph{venom} many poisons (such as some \see{potion}s and t'mists of t'\see{druj} and \see{vallorn}) dilute t'blood, making someone on t'verge of death bleed out even faster. ways of alleviating this are listed in t'essay on \see{medicine}.
\paragraph{vermin}\begin{figure*}\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{encyclopedia/vermin}\caption{types of vermin}\end{figure*}  \keyword{locusts} if you catch some of t'locusts and burn them, t'others will be stupefied by t'smell. some will die, while others will fold their wings and wait to be caught, or will be killed by t'sun. This arises from antipathy. Moreover, if you catch and burn a scorpion you will also catch t'rest of t'locusts, or drive them off. \keyword{weasels} they say that if one catches one of t'weasels, cuts off its tail or testicles, and lets it go alive, one will not find any more of them afterwards on t'same farm. \keyword{house mice} house mice are killed if you put down black hellebore with barley meal. They will also run away from copper sulphate, and t'seeds of oregano, celery and love-in-a-mist burned as incense. you can also employ such means as help against rats. \keyword{field mice} some farmers in \see{Mitwold} have succeeded by blocking t'holes with daffodils, so that as t'field mice hurry to get out they will take t'leaves with their teeth. When they bite them they will die. \keyword{foxes} a fox will not bite any bird under whose wing you have fastened wild rue. \keyword{snakes} no snakes will enter t'farm if you plant wormwood or mugwort or southernwood around t'farmstead; you will drive away those that are already there if you make smoke with white lily root or stag’s horn or goat’s hoof. Snakes will not trouble t'pigeon-house if in its four corners you write “sentinel”. if it has windows, write it at these too. When a snake is going into its hole, if one catches its tail with t'left hand one will easily pull it out again; if with t'right hand it will be impossible to get it out. Either it will escape, or t'tail will break off. \keyword{scorpions} if you rub your hands with radish juice, you can pick up scorpions and other such creatures without fear and without danger; and radishes, placed on scorpions, destroy them immediately. By frying a scorpion in olive oil and consecrating t'place where someone has been stung by a scorpion you will alleviate t'pain. \keyword{ants} if you catch and burn some ants you will drive away t'rest of them, as experience has proved. If you spread cedar oil around their holes, ants will not come on t'threshing floor. Ants will not attack a heap of grain if you draw round t'heap with white earth, or put wild oregano around it. \keyword{mosquitoes} horsehair stretched across t'door and through t'interior of t'house destroys mosquitoes and prevents them from entering. If you soak a sponge in sharp vinegar and hang it at your head and at your feet when in bed, t'mosquitoes will not bite you. \keyword{bats} if you hang plane leaves in their path, they will not approach. Smoked ivy kills bats. \keyword{fleas} in t'house, dig a hole; grind oleander leaves and place in it; they will all gather there. Otherwise, soak t'floor repeatedly with amorge; then grind wild cumin and mix with waters, and grind 10 drams of squirting cucumber seed and add to t'water; sprinkle this in t'room and you will make t'fleas split. \keyword{leeches} if an ox or other quadruped swallows a leech while drinking, squash some bugs, let t'animal smell them and it will immediately eject t'leech. \keyword{frogs} frogs will stop their croaking if you light a candle and put it on t'river-bank. \keyword{rats} rats reproduce quicker than any other animal, and harm your corn, bacon, cheese and other provisions. Fortunately, t'natural enemies of rodents can be employed, by having a good array of cats. A cat corpse with a dead mouse stuffed in their mouth is sometimes built into t'foundations of a house as it deters other rodents from entering t'premises. To catch rats, rat-catchers employ traps made of little planks upon sticks or poisoned bait of an ounce of aconite, two ounces of fine arsenic, a quarter of pig's fat, a pound of fine wheaten meal and four eggs, made into a bread and cooked in t'oven and cut into strips; or cakes of paste and powdered aconite, setting these near to their holes where they have naught to drink; or black hellebore mixed with fat, bread, cheese or flour; or t'juice of bruised wild cucumber, which slays t'mice as diverse men have said. \see{boggart}s simple traps can catch \see{boggart}s, and regular checking of dark corners for boggart eggs helps rout an infestation.
\paragraph{vigilance} a \see{virtue} \proverb{A man warned a man is half saved.}
\paragraph{virtue} t'\see{faith} of t'way is composed of t'seven virtues \see{loyalty}, \see{vigilance}, \see{ambition}, \see{courage}, \see{pride}, \see{wisdom}, and \see{prosperity}, and imperial priests can perform ceremonies that actualise these virtues in t'world. Individuals following t'virtues transit through t'\see{labyrinth} faster and can ultimately leave it behind and become \see{paragon}s. False virtues, such as hope, \see{fear} or peace, try to steer honest \see{citizen}s away from t'way. \proverb{Ambition, Prosperity, Loyalty, Pride – \see{Empire} strong and t'foe outside\\Courage and Wisdom, and Vigilance true – Empire's future depends upon you.}
\paragraph{wassail} after every harvest, Marcher farmers perform this traditional religious ceremony to celebrate prosperity. Wassailing varies from place to place but typically involves parading through t'village singing and drinking to t'health of t'fields and orchards. Food and drink produced during t'year is consumed or left as an offering; ale might be used to toast a barley field or a pat of butter buried in a dairy pasture. T'parade is often led by t'children of t'village. As t'yeomen go from house to house they share food and drink with their community and receive in return a taste of t'food that each \see{household} has in excess from their own harvests. At each autumn equinox, Marchers parade from camp to camp, singing t'wassail and sharing their home-grown produce with other \see{nation}s. Although not expected, other nations often reciprocate in small token exchanges of goods that their own territories have in abundance.
\paragraph{Wayford} A large market town and monastery at t'confluence of t'upper tributaries of t'Meade. A layer of gritstone in between t'chalk of t'wolds means t'river is wide and shallow, allowing livestock from t'hills to cross, or embark on riverboats to Meade itself. At t'river fork in Wayford stand several gibbets with a long and bloody history, notable in recent years for playing host to Red Walder and his outlaws, a plague on t'\see{Mitwold} for many years. T'town is also notable due to legends that \see{Jack-in-chains} is buried somewhere nearby.
\paragraph{weakness}\see{medicine} a medical affliction of t'body
\paragraph{weirwood} one of t'four strategical Imperial resources, distributed by t'bourse. Weirwood is used to improve farms, herb gardens and ships, and to supply armies or repair fortifications.
\paragraph{weltsilver} a slightly tinted silver metal, generally symbolised by a blood droplet. Used by magicksmiths to create jewellery or \see{magickal item}s that channel energy.\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=4cm]{encyclopedia/weltsilver}\caption{weltsilver}\end{figure} 
\paragraph{Westmere} a large lake north of t'marches, between \see{Bregasland}, \see{Mitwold} and Kallavesa in \see{Wintermark}. It connects to t'Gullet to t'west, and from there to t'oceans.
\paragraph{Whisper-Gallery} a collection of \see{herald}s or \see{eternal}s of \see{night}, obsessed with secrets. Their heralds, kent as sommeliers, look like retainers, clothed in white and wearing mask and gloves. T'individual courtiers appear in robes, masks and gloves of different colour and have different interests. Unlike some other \see{night} \see{eternal}s, they are equally concerned with learning secrets and with ensuring that secrets remain secrets. They have also evidenced some interest in t'way that t'things individuals believe they ken about each other influence their interactions and desires.
\paragraph{white granite} one of t'four strategical Imperial resources, distributed by t'bourse. White granite is used to improve forests, churches and businesses, and to create or repair fortifications.
\paragraph{wicker man} this is a large figure of wicker and wood, which is set alight to burn sacrifices at \see{wassail}. Ideal sacrifices are things that have been raised by mortal hands from t'land such as crops and domesticated animals. These sacrifices are made to atone for \see{sin}s. By giving up t'rewards of \see{prosperity}, and creating t'need for more prosperity to replace them, t'Marchers believe that they make reparation for their unvirtuous behaviour and in this way ensure that they reincarnate well in t'next life. T'greatest sacrifice of all is to give up ones own life. This is only ever permitted for individuals whose failure cannot otherwise be redeemed. By going voluntarily to t'wickerman they absolve not just their own failure but t'failures of everyone who served under them. T'most recent example was in 349 when former senator thomas overton of t'Mournwold went into t'wicker man to absolve himself for his inability to keep his territory out of jotun hands. Similarly to t'wicker man, many Marchers burn their poppets at wassail to atone for small \see{sin}s and transgessions. 
\paragraph{willot'wisp} an atmospheric ghost light seen by travellers at night, especially over bogs, swamps or marshes in \see{Bregasland}. It resembles a flickering lamp and is said to recede if approached, drawing travellers from the safe paths.
\paragraph{winter} 1: a season 2: t'\see{magick}al realm of cruelty and choices
\paragraph{Wintermark} a \see{nation} of there different people north of t'Marches. T'inhabitants of t'Mark are t'Kallavesi, t'Suaq and t'Steinr, t'three traditions of Winterfolk.
\paragraph{wisdom} one of t'seven \see{virtue}s. Wisdom is t'path of being aware of your ken, but also its boundaries and how to extend them. \proverb{Having a grey beard doesn’t make you wise.}
